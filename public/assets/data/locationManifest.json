        "Description_full": "Hospital care was one of the integral missions of the newly created U. S. Army Air Base on land donated by the City of Myrtle Beach. As the base was built at the outset of World War II, the hospital was located about one mile east of here in an area referred to colloquially as Splinter City (hastily built of all wood construction). The hospital provided the basic medical needs for the rapidly growing base military population. The population swelled temporarily from time to time as fighter aircraft units came in for short, intense training periods to hone the bombing and gunnery skills of the young pilots. As part of their medical responsibilities, the hospital also gave medical care to the German prisoners of war who were housed nearby. The hospital supported the medical needs of the many bomber and transport aircrews that used the base for rest and refueling on stopover before taking their aircraft on the long overwater flights to the European Theater of war. The U.S. Army Air Base closed after World War II and most of the Splinter City buildings, including the hospital, were subsequently demolished. ( adjacent marker ) Flight Surgeon Clinic The Flight Surgeons supporting the three Tactical Fighter Wings at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base maintained offices in building 114 at this location. In addition to their normal medical specialties, Flight Surgeons also specialized in Aerospace Medicine. They carried the aeronautical rating of Flight Surgeon and were awarded wings denoting their flight status as Flight Surgeons. The Flight Surgeon played an important role in helping to maintain the health, well-being and combat readiness of flying personnel. Flight Surgeons flew frequently with their fighter units and were particularly attuned to the flying stresses of \"G\" forces and the potential for altitude sickness. ( nearby marker ) Hospital This is the site of the 354th Med Group Hospital, building 114, a 25 bed, two-story facility built in 1958 on what was Farrow Boulevard and Alder Street. The hospital included a well-equipped emergency room, a combined medical/surgical and pediatric ward, a surgical suite with two operating rooms and a cardiac unit. It provided medical care for military members, their families and others who were eligible. The hospital staff was composed of highly qualified professionals. General medicine, internal medicine, general surgery pediatrics, flight medicine, gynecology, optometry and mental health services were provided by the hospital staff. The hospital building is now part of Horry- Georgetown Technical College and serves as a major medical training facility, renamed the Dr. Robert E. Speir, Jr., Healthcare Education Center. ( adjacent marker ) Nurses Quarters The Nurses Quarters, building 115, was constructed in 1959 on Howard Boulevard. The Nurses Quarters provided housing for nurses assigned to duty at the Base hospital.",

Step up to the banquette before you and peer through the vertical wooden posts. This is the view Loyalist soldiers had as they stood guard over the town of Ninety Six. In June 1781, while General Greene's tired troops laid siege to the Star Fort on the north side of town, Patriot Lieutenant Colonel Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee and his Continental troops arrived here on the west side of Ninety Six to lend support. Accompanying Lee was Brigadier General Andrew Pickens, commanding 400 South Carolina militiamen. Lieutenant Colonel Lee's mission was to capture this Loyalists stronghold for the Patriots. His initial attempt did not succeed. At noon on June 18, as part of Greene's final assault on the Star Fort, Lee's men attacked here again. This time they easily breached the stockade walls, but their success was short-lived. Greene's failure to take the Star Fort forced all Patriot troops to make a swift exit from Ninety Six before British reinforcements arrived.",

        "Description_full": "The history of the brass cannon reflects the history of the Upstate of South Carolina during some of its most critical eras of conflict and change. The \"Old Reformer\" is also one of the oldest artifacts in the Upstate, since it arrived here before the town of Anderson Court House or the County existed. The artillery arrived in the Upstate in 1814, when the cannon was transported from Charleston to the Upstate to protect the settlers during the War of 1812. The cannon was thought to have been brought to the Americas in 1764 by German emigrants settling in Charleston. In the years following the War of 1812, the cannon was forgotten until it was moved to Anderson in the late 1850s. One legend states that the name \"Old Reformer\" became its nickname at this time. The artillery piece was fired to announce the signing of the Ordinance of Secession in 1860 and possible on a few other wartime occasions. By this time, its original carriage was gone due to neglect and age. In 1876, the cannon made another appearance during the South Carolina gubernatorial campaign of Wade Hampton. His political movement, known as the \"Red Shirts,\" fired the cannon off during political speeches throughout the Upstate and announced his election win. About this time the cannon, now just the barrel, disappeared from history until it was found buried in the ground near the Anderson freight depot on South Fant Street. It was placed in the garden of the Hubbard House on Calhoun Street for a few years until it was rescued by members of the Cateechee Chapter of the Daughters of American Revolution in 1905-06. The barrel was then placed on cement supports at the intersection of North Main and Orr Street across from Central Presbyterian Church. Within a few years it had become a traffic hazard. In 1920, Mayor Foster Fant had a make-shift carriage built for the \"Old Reformer\" and a plaque attached. The cannon was then placed on the Plaza near the Confederate Monument. The new Anderson County Courthouse was completed in 1991, and the \"Old Reformer\" was placed on a brick alcove on the newly designed plaza. In June 2010, the cannon was moved to the Anderson County Museum for its continued preservation.",

It was one of five such trains that traveled across the country to reach Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, for the 1976 July fourth Independence Day celebration, after having scouted ahead for overnight stops, the wagon train left Stone Mountain, Georgia, on April 1, 1976 under the direction of Pensacola, Florida native Harry Lee. When it arrived to the South Carolina border, the convoy was joined by State Wagon Master Dr. Larry Hudson and wagon teamsters Hennison Hartley and Woody Drury, as well as other South Carolinians. During the two week journey through the state, the caravan made several stops in Chester County where local horse enthusiasts joined on horseback and in wagons. Lewisville Mayor John B. McCrorey welcomed the group on May 6 as they camped overnight at the high school football field. The next day the wagon train traveled to the town park in Lowrys where they were greeted by Mayor Marion E. Johnson and other townspeople. Members of the North Chester Saddle Club dressed in period costumes to greet the visitors, while others held a quilting bee, demonstrated lye soap making, displayed antiques and patriotic quilts and served homemade vegetable soup from an old iron pot to commemorate the bicentennial celebration. Lowrys Thursday Afternoon Book Club held an open house and dedicated the newly restored Circulating Free Library. An exhibition of arrow points, artifacts, implements and relics from the Robert J. Shannon Collection was displayed. To add to the festivities, seven Penn State University students who were traveling with the wagon train presented a 45-minute musical despite a downpour. Local residents who rode with the wagon train at various points along the way to Valley Forge included William and Betty Stephenson and their daughters Bonnie and Sherry, Neely Dove, along with Frank and Frances Stephenson. William and family finished the 6 week journey of the wagon train from Clarksville, Virginia to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Neely and wife Laverne, help look after their farm while they were away. On July 4, 1976, President Gerald Ford reviewed the state wagons and documents of signatures reaffirming the principles upon which America was founded.

Compressed air was fed into the drill, which operated a piston that hammered the bit into the rock as it rotated in the chuck. Once the hole was deep enough, explosives were placed inside to break the ore into more manageable pieces. Water was not used in conjunction with this particular drill to lubricate the bit so a huge amount of dust was created. The drill earned the nickname &amp;#8220;widowmaker&amp;#8221; because many of the men who operated the drill died from illnesses related to inhaling too much dust.",

Bennett served as intendent of Charleston (1812-1813) and governor of South Carolina (1820-1822). The frame structure rests on a raised basement with a gable roof highlighted on both north and south elevations by a central pediment lunette and flanked by paired gabled dormers. The five-bay wide main facade has a central door framed by a transom and sidelights with decorative tracery. Windows and louvered shutters are nine over nine lights. The two tiered piazza with Tuscan columns and turned balusters span the south facade and a portion of the west facade. A rear addition was added in the late nineteenth century. Bennett operated rice and lumber mills in partnership with his father, Thomas Bennett, Sr. The elder Bennett, along with Daniel Cannon and Jonathan Lucas, Jr., were pioneers in establishing lumber and rice mills in the Charleston area. The Bennetts were also partners in the architectural firm Bennett and Son. The design of the Classical Revival style Bennett Rice Mill on Washington Street is attributed to Thomas Bennett, Jr. In 1825 the house was sold to Mrs. Susan McElhenny, whose daughter Emily married Paul Hamilton Hayne, a lieutenant in the United States Navy. Their son, the noted poet and editor Paul Hamilton Hayne (1830- 1886), was born here. In 1856 Hayne founded Russell's Magazine, a prominent southern literary journal. In the 1870s Hayne became known as the \"poet laureate of the South.\" The interior of 113 Ashley Avenue is notable for its original woodwork and elegant central staircase.",

The house was completed by Mrs. Middleton and her second husband and former brother-in-law, Major General Thomas Pinckney, whom she married in 1797. In addition to his military service, Pinckney served as President George Washington�s Minister to the Court of St. James and in 1796 made an unsuccessful bid for vice president of the United States. When constructed, the Middleton-Pinckney House sat on a bluff beside a large creek to the north that was later filled to accommodate Calhoun Street. Based on the cruciform plan in the Neoclassical style, this stucco over brick house with hipped roof has a polygonal front projection, which provides oval rooms on each floor, and a truncated rear projection that contains a winding staircase. The understated main entrance is in a portal on the basement level and is framed by white marble columns and a simple marble entablature. Marble flat arches top the six-over-six light windows on the George Street facade with fan shaped voussoirs. Two marble belt courses break the vertical lines at the upper stories. In 1880 the building was sold to the Water Works Company which later became the Charleston Commissioners of Public Works (CPW). The CPW constructed a reservoir at the rear of the site. The reservoir was later converted for use as a public swimming pool until it was closed in the 1960s. A two million-gallon capacity pump and offices occupied the main house. A water tower stood on the west side of the house. In 1988 the building became the headquarters for the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. In 2002 the City of Charleston donated the Middleton-Pinckney House to the Festival which rehabilitated the building with major support from the William E. Murray family. The garden, designed by Sheila Wertimer, was created with the support of Marion and Wayland Cato.",

        "Name": "1948 Myrtle Beach Airport",
        "Description_full": "In 1948, the War Assets Administration transferred to the Town of Myrtle Beach the Army Air Base. Since the maintenance and operation of an airport is a year-round proposition, it was easy to see that the town had embarked upon a big venture.When the officials took over the former base, which had cost the Government $5,000,000, Mayor H.W. Tallevast appointed a five-man commission to negotiate with the War Assets Administration for the property, to hire an airport manager, and to take all steps necessary to develop an undertaking where the non-aviation revenue would offset the deficit in the airport operations. The Commission then charged the Airport Manager, E.A. Anthony, with making the Myrtle Beach Airport self-supporting. He adopted a short range program to raise money for the immediate operation and also a long range one to put the airport ultimately on a self-sustaining basis. The Airport Commission began looking at the basic layout map of the installation, blocked into areas, marking those which were to be developed according to their highest and best use. One section of the airfield, originally used for housing troops, was in the southwest corner of the airfield, adjoining several thousand acres of woodland. Soon occupying this tract were three turkey farms, raising approximately 50,000 birds per year. This venture started with skepticism because it was feared that airplanes flying at low altitudes would cause the turkeys to stampede. On the contrary, the turkeys soon became accustomed to aircraft and paid little attention to them. ( photo caption ) A scene on one of three turkey farms, showing a few of the 50,000 birds raised annually on land which once quartered troopd during the war. The turkeys were not disturbed by planes at the airport. ( adjacent marker ) 1948 Myrtle Beach Airport Baseball clubs conducting spring training activities in Florida sparked the idea to go after a baseball training camp for the Myrtle Beach airport, for the hospital area was large enough to accommodate approximately 400 persons, and there was ample space for field training.Most of the major league teams were contacted. Officials of the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Braves made personal inspections of the facilities. After a few months of negotiations, a contract was signed with the Boston Braves to make the airport the training base for the entire farm system. Many baseball officials who visited the site claimed that it was the best and most practical training camp they had examined. A training field was laid out in one large square which was 900 feet on each side. A tower 20 feet high was constructed in the middle of the square. Four ball fields pointed out from the tower. Baseball managers and coaches could sit in the tower and watch four complete ball games in progress simultaneously. ( photo caption ) Part of the airport served as a spring training base for the entire Boston Braves farm system. Four baseball diamonds were grouped around a 20 foot tower designed for coaches and officials to observe the games. Anthony, A. E. Airports and Airways   Aero Digest, April 1950 ( adjacent marker ) 1948 Myrtle Beach Airport The airport located on United States Highway 17, was a direct route between New York and Miami, approximately halfway between these two points. This initiated another project, a tourist's trailer court. The trailer court boasted a picnic shelter house with two large fireplaces, four oyster bars, writing tables and other conveniences. In addition, there was a shower and laundry room which had ample hot and cold water all year 'round. The Airport Commission was also successful in recruiting small industries to utilize many of the buildings at the airport. The Electrical Reactance Corporation located a plant here. The company made radio condensers and hired approximately 240 women. Among other productive side uses, the airport was also the winter home of two large carnivals. For the next several years, the airport supported commercial flight operations. During this period, the United States saw a need to rebuild its armed forces in the face of the looming threat posed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and its support of communism in various parts of the world. In planning the buildup, the airport was a candidate to become a major Air Force base. This planning was helped along when the City of Myrtle Beach offered, in 1954, to donate the Municipal Airport and associated real estate to the Air Force. The airport was redesignated Myrtle Beach Air Force Base on April 1, 1954. ( photo caption ) The tourist�s trailer court was shaded by pine and dogwood trees. The court included a picnic shelter house with all of the conveniences. Anthony, A. E. Airports and Airways   Aero Digest, April 1950",

The Adam Ewing House was constructed after the Great Fire of 1778 which destroyed much of this neighborhood. It is notable for its simple and elegant design substantially built of stuccoed masonary with stuccoed jack arches articulating the tops of windows and doors in the facade. The entrance on Tradd Street was the public entrance to the counting house with the private residential entrance down the walk to the side.",

        "Description_full": "Legare Street is named for goldsmith Solomon Legare &amp;#8220;the Huguenot,&amp;#8221; who built the first house on this property. Before the lot left the family in 1803, his descendants had become wealthy plantation owners and commission merchants. This large U-shaped house was built in at least four stages. The earliest section (front right) is part of the eighteenth century dwelling that replaced Legare�s original house. Merchants Jacob Steinmetz and Paul Lorent retained this three story, one room wide section when they constructed what is now the central portion ca. 1803. By 1818 they had added long brick wing (left), which boasts one of Charleston�s most elegant ballrooms, and the separate kitchen house facing Tradd Street. In about 1849 George Hopley added a rear wing to the right side. From 1819 through 1848, Anne Talvande kept a &amp;#8220;select academy for young ladies&amp;#8221; here. One of South Carolina�s best-known literary women, Mary Boykin Chesnut, was educated by Madame Talvande. The Sword Gate was made by ironworker Christopher Werner in 1838 for the city�s new Guard House, but never used until Hopley installed it here in about 1849. During the Charleston Renaissance in the early 20th century, the walls and gates on both Tradd and Legare Street were artists� favorites. The Sword Gate was a subject for Elizabeth O�Neill Verner and Alfred Hutty, while Harold Tatum and others depicted the Tradd Street scene. From 1952 to 1998 while the Sword Gate Inn occupied the brick wing of the house, there were separate dwellings in the main building and kitchen. The entire property was restored as a private residence in 2002.",

        "Description_full": "The 354th Day Fighter Wing was originally composed of three fighting squadrons &amp;#8212; the 353rd, 355th and 356th Day Fighter Squadrons. In 1957, an Air Force-wide reorganization of flying units reduced the number of F-100s assigned to the Myrtle Beach fighter squadrons from 24 to 18. This reorganization led to the creation of a fourth 354th squadron &amp;#8212; the 352nd Day Fighter Squadron. The 352nd squadron &amp;#8220;Yellow Jackets\" became mission capable in December 1957, and in 1958 joined the other wing squadrons in deployments to Turkey and Italy during the Lebanon Crisis.In October 1962, the 352nd, along with the other three fighter squadrons, deployed to McCoy Air Force Base, Florida, in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The squadron deployed to Myrtle Beach in December 1962, and throughout 1963-1965 participated in the wing's normal exercises and deployments. The 352nd was sent to Phan Rang Air Base, South Vietnam, in 1966 to assist in supporting air operations in Southeast Asia. In August of that year, the 352nd Tactical Fighter Squadron was reassigned to the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. The squadron continued flying the F-100 from Phan Rang and subsequently was reassigned again, this time to the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. The 352nd was deactivated at Phan Rang on July 31, 1971, as part of the United States drawdown in Vietnam.

        "Name": "353rd Tactical Fighter Squadron",
        "Description_full": "The 353rd Tactical Fighter squadron was formed on November 15, 1942. During World War II the fighter squadron was known as the \"Fighting Cobras,&amp;#8220; and served with distinction in England, France and Germany, flying the P-39, P-51 and P-47 aircraft. Their successful aerial operations helped establish the Normandy beachhead and aided the rapid advancement of Allied ground forces across France and into Germany. The squadron was reassigned to Bolling Field, District of Columbia, March 31, 1945, and inactivated later that year. On September 28, 1956, the unit was reactivated and designated the 353rd Fighter Day squadron, assigned to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. The 353rd pilots began flying the F-100D Super Sabre and continued to fly that aircraft while the squadron was stationed at Torrejon Air Base, Spain. They returned to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in July 1971 and transitioned to the A-7D Corsair II. In October 1972, the squadron was sent to Southeast Asia where its members participated in Linebacker II operations as the 353rd Tactical Fighter squadron. In May 1973, the unit returned to Myrtle Beach. 353rd Emblem, Courtesy of Gene Lamar ( adjacent marker ) 353rd Tactical Fighter Squadron In August 1978, the 353rd was the third squadron in the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing to become combat operational in the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The \"Black Panthers\" became the first Air Force tactical fighter unit ever to fly combat training sorties from the island of Cuba when members of the squadron deployed there in November 1979. During the 1980s, the squadron participated in numerous high-profile deployments and exercises. Major deployments were conducted in England, Germany and Egypt, while stateside exercises were conducted in numerous locations. Toward the end of this decade, the 353rd's emphasis on training shifted to the Middle East. This proved to be especially relevant when the \"Black Panthers\" was the first air-to-ground fighter squadron deployed to Saudi Arabia to conduct combat operations in Iraq during Desert Shield/Desert Storm. During Desert Storm, the \"Black Panthers\" spearheaded the aerial assault against Iraq's ground forces. They were responsible for destroying hundreds of Iraqi armored vehicles and also leading the airborne Combat Search and Rescue efforts that resulted in the successful rescue of several coalition pilots. The \"Black Panthers' ceased operations from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in 1992, and subsequently moved to Alaska to rejoin the 354th Wing at Eielson Air Force Base. The mission of the 353rd Tactical Fighter Squadron is to maintain the capability to deploy worldwide and provide close air support, anti-armor operations, interdiction, and search and rescue operations in a low, medium or high threat environment. The 353rd's tactical fighter missions are designed to destroy enemy forces and equipment through the use of the 30mm cannon, Maverick missile and a wide range of other conventional munitions. ( adjacent marker ) 353rd Tactical Fighter Squadron Operations The headquarters for the 353rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, building 349, was located near this spot. Its mascot is the Panther. The unit has a long and illustrious history having been first activated at Hamilton Field, California, in 1942. The unit began flying P-39 Bell Air Cobra fighters. As World War II accelerated, the Squadron was sent to England and began flying the P-51 Mustang. It achieved an illustrious aerial combat record in this aircraft and, later, in the P-47 Thunderbolt. After the war, the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated. In the nation's military build-up in response to the communist threat, the squadron was re-activated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in 1956 and began flying the F-100 Super Sabre. Later after transitioning into the the A-7D Corsair II, it flew combat missions during the Vietnam War. When the A-7 aircraft were re-assigned to the Air National Guard, the unit was among the first to become combat ready in the newly assigned A-10 Thunderbolt II. After the base de-activated and closed in 1993, the squadron was transferred to Eielsen Air Force Base, Alaska, where it remains today. ( adjacent marker ) Parachute Shop The Parachute Shop located in this area contained all the necessary space and equipment to repair, clean, maintain inspect and repack both parachutes used by flight crew members and the drag chutes used by the F-100 to aid in stopping the aircraft during landing rollout. The tall tower section of the building was packing used to suspend and dry the parachutes and to allow for complete inspection to help ensure the integrity of the material. During the heyday of the F-100 at Myrtle Beach, 90 percent of the work of the shop was devoted to caring for the F-100 drag chutes. After closure of the base, the building was sold to a privately owned company. On average 40, to 50 F-100 drag chutes were packed at the Parachute Shop. A2C Albert Nedley (r) uses a hook for packing. Master Sergeant John Fletterer operates his &amp;#8220;jig,\" a device he invented, to expedite the packing of jet fighter drag chutes into a canister. The invention was later used by the Air Force. ( adjacent marker ) Security Police Operations The Security Police Headquarters, building 350, was located in this area. It housed the administrative offices of the squadron, contained an arsenal for the storage of security police weapons, and provided a holding area for those who were being detained by security police. The mission of the squadron was to provide security and law enforcement for the base. In doing so, one of it's key security functions was to ensure the security of the Wing's combat aircraft.",

The 354th Fighter Wing remains mission-ready today to fly and fight any place in the world in defense of our country. ( photo caption ) 354th Tactical Fighter Wing &amp;#8211; 1991",

In the European Theater, each squadron was assigned to an air base in Western Europe to which it would deploy if NATO were directly threatened or attacked. Practice deployments to these bases were accomplished periodically. In the Pacific Theater, a detachment of aircraft and ground crews was maintained in Hawaii on a continuing basis for reinforcement. In the Southern Theater, a tactical fighter detachment was maintained at Howard Air Force Base as part of the defense of the Panama Canal Zone. The Wing was relieved of these tasks while of it was deployed to Southeast Asia in support of combat operations in Vietnam. ( adjacent marker ) 354th First A-10 Operational Wing The decade of the 1980s was mainly devoted to training and preparing to meet the United States' primary military threat, the Soviet Union. The 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was the first operational A-10 unit. All of the Wing's squadrons were actively involved in developing deployment procedures and would ensure the Wing would be prepared, on short notice, to deploy and conduct combat operations worldwide, primarily in Europe.

Programs were varied to meet the youth's needs according to their age, abilities and preference. The had two lighted tennis courts and two lighted outdoor multi-purpose courts available for the youth population. In 1991, a new Youth Center was constructed on Swallow Street. The building was complete with a gymnasium with six basketball goals. The two end goals could be retracted automatically and the four side goals could be moved manually. A snack bar, game room and meeting rooms also were included. The floor of the gym was safe against any wear. It was even safe for roller skating. The Youth Center was transferred to Horry Georgetown Technical College in 1995.",

The 356th participated in numerous deployments to Europe during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and also deployed in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis. From April 1963 until June 1964, the 356th deployed on several occasions to Turkey and Italy. Then, in November 1965, flying F-4 Phantoms, the 356th was assigned to Misawa Air Base, Japan, in support of the Vietnam conflict. In the early 1970s, the 356th was reassigned to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base and transitioned to the A-7D Corsair II. The squadron was subsequently deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, supporting United States efforts in the Vietnam conflict. The \"Green Demons\" became the first operational A-10 TAC-FTR Thunderbolt ll unit in October 1977. A-7Ds in flight over Thailand ( adjacent marker ) 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron The 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated at Hamilton Field, California, in 1942. Originally called the \"Red Asses,\" they were first assigned to fly the P-39 Aircobra, but transitioned into the P-51 Mustang when the unit was transferred to the European Theater in 1943. The 356th participated in both long-range bomber escort and ground support missions. In November 1944, the squadron switched from the P-51 to the P-47 Thunderbolt. However, in March 1945, the units switched back to the P-51, which they continued to fly until the end of the war. During World War II, 356th pilots shot down 298 enemy aircraft, accumulating nine aces among its ranks, including Major James Howard who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. At the end of the war, the 356th remained with the Occupation Forces in Europe until February 1946. The squadron returned to Bolling field, District of Columbia, and was subsequently deactivated in May 1946. 356th WWII Emblem Courtesy of Gene Lamar ( adjacent marker ) 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron During the 1980s, the 356th spearheaded the integration of the A-10 into the tactical air forces. They were instrumental in developing many of the tactics that were adopted by A-10 units world-wide. These tactics were verified in such high-profile exercises as Red Flag (Nevada), Team Spirit (Korea) and Cope Elite (Hawaii). The \"Green Demons\" squadron flag was retired in June 1992.

The lot was originally granted by the Lords Proprietors on June 12, 1694 to John Frowman, a butcher, for an annual rent of one penny. This three and one-half story Georgian style Single House, and two story brick dependency building were constructed in 1768 by James Brown, a master carpenter. Brown represented St. Michael's and St. Philip's Parishes in the Provincial Congresses, participated in the construction of the first South Carolina State House, and was imprisoned by the British during the Revolutionary War. The handsome two-tiered Regency style piazzas and entry door surround were added between 1810 and 1830 by the Lehre' or Gantt families, who owned the house during this period. During the 1860s, the house was owned as an investment by George A. Trenholm, a merchant. Trenholm served as Secretary of the Treasury for the Confederate States of America from July 1864 to April 1865, and also was engaged in blockade running during the Civil War.",

This allowed us to get more men on ships being sent across the Atlantic Ocean to aid our British and French allies. The howitzer was designed to shell enemy trenches from great distances. The 6 inch Field Howitzer was one of the largest tactical guns used by the United States. It fired several types of ammunition including High Explosive (HE), Shrapnel, and Gas shells. Guns such as this were produced by the Watervliet Arsenal in Troy, New York. Howitzers were used in World War I to continuously shell enemy trenches during the day and throughout the night. This was done to rattle the nerves of the enemy and keep them from getting any rest. The shelling also was done to destroy enemy trenches and collapse dugouts. An offensive attack usually followed this type of barrage. This type of howitzer was still used by the American Army at the beginning of World War II.",

Double piazzas supported by slender columns span the east fa�ade, shallow arches highlight the first floor piazza, as does the central doorway which is capped with a semi-elliptical transom typical of the period. Shortly after construction Captain Saltus put the property in trust for his daughter Susan Ann Lubbock, wife of Beaufort physician Dr. Henry Thomas Willis Lubbock. Their eldest child Francis Richard Lubbock served as Governor of Texas (1861-1865) and the town of Lubbock, Texas was named for him. The property was sold in 1832 to Otis Mills, a wealthy entrepreneur and financier who developed the original Mills House, one of Charleston's premier antebellum hotels. In the early twentieth century 6 Water Street was converted into 10 apartments. It was rehabilitated back to use as a single family residence in the 1960s. Water Street follows the course of Vanderhorst Creek, which was filled in during the first decade of the 19th century. In September 1775 Lord William Campbell, the last Royal Governor of South Carolina, used Vanderhorst Creek to escape from the city.",

Grindley rented one half of the building and used the other half as his residence and law office. At his death in 1765 the property was deeded to his nephews, Dr. Alexander Fotheringham and Dr. Archibald McNeill, who each used half of the building as a primary residence. Their wives, Isabel Fotheringham and Mary McNeill, were granddaughters of South Carolina Chief Justice Robert Wright and the nieces of Sir James Wright, Royal Governor of Georgia. It was rare in Charleston that the owners occupied tenement buildings as they were usually built for rental purposes. In the mid-nineteenth century the building was converted to a single-family residence by piercing interior walls. The building originally had two entrances at the basement level. By the early twentieth century the main entrance at the eastern end had been raised to the first floor. In the 1960s the window and entrance at the western end were enlarged to accommodate a garage.",

A wealthy Charleston \"goldsmith\" (banker), provincial powder receiver, built this stucco-over brick house circa 1716-33 (near the of the old walled city.) He gave this home as a wedding gift in 1733 to his daughter Mary on her marriage to Dr. Thomas Dale. Dr. Thomas Dale (1700-1750) was a British-trained physician, a judge, and author. Dale served as justice of the peace for Berkeley County in 1734-1737; was administrator of the slave detention workhouse overseer of the public slave markets and served one term in the Commons House representing the parish of St. Peter. He translated medical works, published poetry and wrote the prologue to first play ever performed at the Dock Street Theatre (The Recruiting Officer). Mary Dale died in childbirth in 1737 and is buried with her child at St. Philip's church. Colonel Brewton lived at the southwest corner of Church and Tradd Streets (77 and 75 Church street) and his ownership of this and other adjoining lots led to this area being known as Brewton's Corner and Frances Brewton Pinckney. Charles Pinckney (1732-1782) was a lawyer, president of the Provincial Congress, State Senator, and President of the Senate. Their eldest son, Charles Pinckney (1757-1824), was one of the youngest U.S. founding fathers, principal authors and signers of the U.S. Constitution. He authored the \"Pinckney draft\" of the United States Constitution that provided at least 31 provisions to the Constitution. He served four-terms as Governor, as well as state Senator, U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator and Ambassador to Spain under President Thomas Jefferson. Charles inherited the property in 1787. The house was originally built as a three-story dwelling with a central stair hall and central chimney. It is one of the oldest houses in Charleston and one of the few remaining residences in the U.S. built with small-sized \"Dutch\" brick ( 1&amp;#189;\" x 6�\" x 3\"). The house is also a fine example of one of the earliest homes built on the 30' x 30' chamber plan, typical of houses erected before 1750. By the late nineteenth century the dwelling consisted of only two stories and a covered passageway on the first floor which was converted into a garage in the mid-twentieth century. The third floor was reconstructed in 2004 in an effort to restore the building to its original eighteenth century appearance",

        "Description_full": "This gun is based on the British 15lb. Erhardt gun and was manufactured prior to World War I (1914-1918). Since the gun trail is one piece it could not be elevated easily. It could fire between 20 and 30 rounds of 75mm shells per minute. The 75mm fired mainly explosive and shrapnel shells. Each 75mm shrapnel shell had a time fuse that could be set to explode while still in the air. The shrapnel shell time fuse could be set to fly for 21 seconds. In the event that the time fuse did not work on the shrapnel shells, they were equipped with a back up percussion device so that they would go off on contact with the ground. The effective range of a shrapnel shell was 6,500 yards. This range was shorter than that of British and French guns used in World War I. This type of gun did not see action overseas in World War I. The model was probably used for artillery training by soldiers at nearby Camp Sevier (1917-1918) during World War I. An artillery range was located in the area of present day Highway 11 near Cleveland, S.C. The French provided all of our artillery needs in exchanged for us getting as many Doughboys across the Atlantic Ocean as soon as possible. A gun similar to this was used by Battery D, 129th Field Artillery Regiment, 35th Division, U.S. 1st Army in 1918. Battery D was commanded by future U.S. President - Captain Harry S. Truman. The 75mm Field Gun was used as late as 1941 against the Japanese in the Philippines. This gun was donated by the family of Charlie Crenshaw.",

The date of construction is based on surviving land grants showing the establishment of common use alleys on either side of the property. The original frame upper story and roof were heavily damaged by fires in the mid-eighteenth century and rebuilt circa 1781. The gambrel or \"Dutch gable\" roof is a rare surviving example of an architectural form once common in eighteenth century Charleston. Regrettably, the gambrel roof form has largely disappeared from the city as a result of early twentieth century demolitions. This building was owned and renovated in 1918 by Miss Susan Pringle Frost, founder and first president of the Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings, later renamed the Preservation Society of Charleston. Miss Frost was the guiding force behind the renovation of many buildings in the city, including several on Tradd Street.",

        "Name": "83-107 East Bay Street",
        "Description_full": "Rainbow Row represents the longest cluster of intact Georgian row houses in the United States. The earliest structures on this portion of East Bay Street, between Tradd and Elliott Street, were built by 1680. The buildings were constructed on lots 7 to 10 of the Grand Modell, a city plan developed between 1670-1680. Over the years, the buildings served as the shops and residences of notable merchants and planters, and fronted a cluster of wharves on the Cooper River waterfront. The buildings also fronted a segment of the eastern boundary of the fortification wall constructed circa 1704 to surround the city. Some of the houses were damaged or destroyed by fire, and the present structures date from circa 1720 to circa 1790. The homes suffered slight damage by Union artillery bombardment during the War between the States. After the war and decades of neglect, the buildings deteriorated into slums. Susan Pringle Frost, founder of the Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings, now the Preservation Society of Charleston, began her important preservation and rehabilitation efforts by purchasing some of these properties in the 1920s in order to prevent their demolition. The name Rainbow Row was coined after the pastel colors they were painted as they were restored in the 1930s and 1940s. The rear facades and gardens of 93-101 East Bay were also used as a model for the original 1935 stage setting of George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward�s opera, &amp;#8220;Porgy and Bess.&amp;#8221",

The Ancrum Wharf Building is one of the few wharf-related eighteenth structures surviving in Charleston and abuts one of the only remaining cobblestone streets. Originally constructed as a three-story building, the Ancrum Wharf Building was altered to function as a two-story building during the mid-nineteenth century. The large windows of the upper floor were altered to mask evidence that this tall upper space once comprised two separate floors. When first built the Ancrum Wharf Building was across from a public fish market that lay immediately to the south. During the first half of the nineteenth century the Ancrum Wharf Building served as the offices of James Hamilton and Co. who began a steamship service between Charleston and Savannah in 1836. A decade later, under the direction of shipping magnate James Adger, the area behind the Ancrum Wharf Building became the southern terminus for the first steamship line between Charleston and New York. During the twentieth century, the Gaud School was located in the Ancrum Wharf Building from 1928-1941 and again from 1951-1962. After the Gaud School relocated in 1962, the building was converted into apartments. In 1998 the Ancrum Wharf Building was renovated as a single family residence",

It was used in both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operation during World War II (1941-1945). The 90 mm M-2 AA gun could fire at airplanes up to an altitude of 33,000 feet. Shells were set to explode when they reached a certain altitude. The men who fired this type of gun were known as ack-ack crews. It could be used as a field gun for bombardment and as an anti-tank gun as well. These guns usually operated in batteries consisting of four guns. There are many devices on this gun that had to be operated in order to fire it. Some gun crews had as many as thirteen men working to carry the large shells, set the fuses, load them, operate the dials, and fire the gun. Gun emplacements were covered by camouflage nets to make them harder to see from the air. These guns were usually dug into circular pits about four feet deep and twenty feet across. It took about twelve hours of hard work to get the gun in place to fire it. The 90 mm M-2 AA gun was used to protect Air Force bases and military installations as late as the mid 1950's.",

They were enrollees in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), one of President Franklin Roosevelt's programs to battle the Great Depression. The CCC provided men the immediate assistance of food, lodging, training, and much-needed income. It also offered long-term dividends: CCC-constructed parks, roads and bridges, created infrastructures and recreational opportunities that still benefit our country. Like most CCC buildings, the Table Rock Lodge features local rock and timber. Not only were these materials inexpensive and locally accessible, they also contribute to a style that complements natural surroundings. This lodge, fully restored in 2008, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

The bloody fighting of the Cherokee War of 1760 was followed by years of lawlessness and retribution during the Regulator period. period. During the American Revolution this same extreme violence was continued with Patriots and Tories engaged in a vicious and bitter civil war. In 1816, an itinerant minister, Parson Mason Locke Weems, who had lived in Edgefield, published \"The Devil in Petticoats,\" a dramatic sermon chronicling the deeds of the legendary murderess Becky Cotton. He lamented, \"Will the Lord have mercy upon Old Edgefield! For sure it must be pandemonium itself, a very District of Devils!\" In the antebellum period, many Edgefield men were participants in the tradition of dueling. Among the famous Edgefieldians who dueled were George McDuffie and Louis T. Wigfall. In 1856 Congressman Preston S. Brooks caned Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in the floor of the U.S. Senate. The 1878 Booth-Toney shootout, the 1903 shooting of newspaper editor N.G. Gonzales by Lt. Governor James H. Tillman, and the 1941 Timmerman-Logue affair, all garnered national publicity, perpetuating Edgefield's reputation for violence. Over the years, violence in Edgefield was decried with alarming frequency in its newspapers. It has been said that blood has been shed on every square foot in the Town Square. By the end of the 20th century a number of eminent historians, journalists, and novelists had written extensively about Edgefield's violent past.",

The 1860 census lists Harriet Bratton owning eighty slaves and twenty slave houses. Of those houses this cabin is the lone survivor. Built around 1828 it was one of about four brick quarters clustered around the plantation house. Building with brick was expensive, so most slaves lived in simple wood cabins. These brick cabins may have served to demonstrate the Bratton's wealth and status in the community. Although it is uncertain who lived in this cabin, its proximity to the main house suggests that the inhabitants were slaves who worked in and around the house. Individuals who were skilled in trades such as blacksmithing and woodworking may have also lived in the brick cabins surrounding the Homestead. Despite better living conditions the occupants of these houses had virtually no rights, worked at the desire of their owners, and lived in conditions not of their own making. 1843 Slave Inventory At the time of his death in 1843, Dr. Bratton owned 139 enslaved individuals. This made him one of the largest slave owners in York County. Slave Cabin Artifacts These artifacts - buttons, a glass bead, a comb and dish fragment uncovered during the excavation of a collapsed slave cabin - give us insight into the possessions and daily lives of the enslaved community. Slave Made Brick In addition to working in the fields, Bratton slaves also made bricks for use on the plantation.

During the mid-1700's the demand was high among backcountry residents for a means to grind their crops without having to make a trip that could take days to complete.\n\nIn the early settlements of the upstate, grist mills were built along the abundant rivers in the area. Early mills were powered by water with a water wheel that would turn the millstones, usually placed in pairs-an upper and lower-that caused the grain and corn to be ground on the bed stone. Grooves and slats were cut into the grinding stone by hand to help with the crushing of the grain. Because of the location of Musgrove�s Mill, the British became interested in it during the American Revolution. British and Tory troops made this a central point for the movement of supplies, fording the river and in helping them establish control over transportation and communication in the region. On August 19, 1780, Patriot forces faced an overwhelming number of British and Tory troops in a fierce battle that resulted in a Patriot victory.",

The relatively large number of military artifacts suggests that it might have been a temporary shelter for soldiers on duty within the palisade.

Many items now made from metal were originally made of wood - even locks and keys - because metal was expensive and wood was free. Due to its wide availability and relative softness, pine was used most often in crafting farm furniture and tools. Hardwoods, such as hickory, walnut and mahogany, were more likely to be found in wealthier homes. Many modern Americans can make simple household repairs, but the need to be self-sufficient was far greater for our ancestors on isolated farms. Basic woodworking was a survival skill for yeoman farmers.",

The 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was the first Wing to receive the A-7D, the first plane arriving September 9, 1970. The Corsair II was equipped with an automated electronic navigation and weapon delivery system and demonstrated outstanding capability to attack ground targets while deployed to Southeast Asia in support of the Vietnam War. The phase-out of the A-7D at Myrtle Beach started in the summer of 1974 with the A-7Ds being transferred to Air National Guard units.

        "Name": "Abbeville Square",
        "Description_full": "The heart of Abbeville's Historic District is the magnificent tree-shaded Court Square. Located here is the replica of the original Confederate Monument erected in August, 1906 by the Daughters of the Confederacy, an old iron bell once used as the town fire alarm, and the Humane Society Alliance Fountain. We hope you'll take time to visit the many significant historic buildings that stand watch over the Square while in Abbeville. Belmont Inn Opened in 1903 as the Eureka Hotel, this \"Spanish style\" structure with its broad verandas catered to \"drummers\" (salesmen) of the textile trade. In its heyday the Inn also hosted the performers from the Opera House next door. Closed in the early 1970s, it was reopened in 1984. Trinity Episcopal Church Located just off the Square down a paved brick street, Trinity was consecrated in 1860. Its 128-foot spire dominates the skyline and the church is known for its \"pink\" stucco Gothic construction. Abbeville Opera House Designed by Edwards and Walter of Atlanta, the City Hall/Opera House and County Courthouse were dedicated on October 1, 1908. Nine days later the first show opened, \"The Great Divide.\" Abbeville was a railway stopover for \"road companies\" traveling the eastern seaboard from New York and became well known for its live performances by big names of the times. During the 1920s talking movies replaced live theatre and by the early 1960s it closed. In 1968 the Opera House was restored and continues to offer live theatre during the season. Old Bank Building This structure was built around 1858 and opened after the Civil War as a branch of the Bank of South Carolina. The two-story stucco brick structure survived the devastating fires of the 1970s and is one of the oldest buildings in town. Today it serves as the Welcome Center for Abbeville. However from 1865 until 1996 it served as a bank and was given to the town by National Bank (now Bank of America). Humane Society Alliance Fountain Originally conceived by Minnie Maddern Fiske, an actress and activist, the Humane Society Alliance mission was to improve the lot of workhorses. The five ton fountain was installed in 1912 and features a unique design, which includes an upper bowl for horses and small cups for dogs and cats. Abbeville County Courthouses This is the sixth courthouse built in Abbeville, which was designed in the beaux-style by Edwards and Walter and dedicated with the Opera House in 1908.",

Many slaves hoped that the British would give them their freedom, and risked harsh retribution from rebel masters by assisting the King's army as spies, wagon drivers, and by gathering provisions. During the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill, the British armed African Americans to help defend Camden. Some slaves remained with their American masters. After the British forced Sarah Kershaw from her home in 1780, her slaves took great risks to provide her family with food. \"You will order one hundred able Negroes, furnished with spades to be collected from the plantations in your neighbourhood, and send them to Camden.\" Lord Cornwallis",

        "Description_full": "In Greenville! Joy eats 2 bales of hay, 25 pounds of grain, 20 pounds of fruits and vegetables, with vitamin supplements added, and browse. Total food consumption is up to 200 pounds each day. Joy, a female, weighs over 8,000 pounds and is just under 8 feet tall. Females are smaller than males, but not dainty. It's impolite to ask a lady her age, however, Joy was born in 1970 and has been a popular resident of the Greenville Zoo since 1977. Because \"elephant years\" are about the same as human years, you can expect to visit Joy for many years to come. Each morning, Joy is bathed and her back and feet scrubbed thoroughly. During her morning bath, she is inspected carefully for anything out of the ordinary, her teeth are examined and the condition of each foot is reviewed closely. An elephant's feet must be kept in very good condition at all times. They put a lot of weight on their feet and can't just sit back and put their feet up as we do. A cut or scrape or any cracking of the skin on the pads of their feet could easily result in lameness or worse, a life threatening infection. In addition to the daily inspection and cleaning of her feet, the pads of her feet are trimmed regularly as are her toenails. Yet, she does have her nails done regularly. In the Wild! Elephants eat just about any kind of plant material; grasses, flowers, fruit, and even known down trees for leaves and bark. They may consume up to 350 pounds of food a day, depending on the quality. Males, the largest living land animals, can weigh over 12,000 pounds and reach a height of more than 12 feet. Elephants live 60 to 70 years. A \"natural\" cause of death for old elephants is worn out teeth. They have four very large molars or grinding teeth. As they wear out, they are replaced, but only six times throughout their life. When the last molars wear out, they can no longer grind their food, ultimately starving. Elephants live in herds of 6 to 12 animals, sometimes more. The herd is led by the matriarch, usually the oldest, most experienced female, and includes her daughters and their offspring, but no adult males. They mare at about 15 years of age. Pregnancy last 22 months; the single calf weights about 250 pounds at birth and nurses for two years. Mothers, grandmothers, sisters and aunts all help raise babies. Male calves leave the herd as they reach puberty. Adult males live alone or in \"breeder bands.\" When a male is reach to breed, he approaches the matriarch-led herd, signaling his intentions. When done, he rejoins the \"bachelor band\" or goes off on his own. Are They Endangered? There are two species of elephants, the African and the Asian, Elephas maximus. The Asian elephant is endangered, with only 30,000 to 40,000 remaining in the wild. African elephants are threatened, a step away from endangered, with about 600,000 remaining, down from 1.5 million in 1978. Their rapid decline was due to the loss of habitation and to the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory tusks. A world-wide ban on the trade in ivory has greatly reduced, but not eliminated the numbers killed for their tusks. Habitat loss occurs when human population and activities increase and the elephant's territory is broken into smaller and smaller pieces, leaving them without enough space to live and eat. When protected, as in a national park, elephants thrive and the herds grow. But, if the growth is not controlled, they will eat themselves out of house and home. In the past, excess animals were shot or died of starvation. Now, birth control is being viewed as a solution. Elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa have been inoculated with a birth control vaccine. The Greenville Zoo was one of two zoos that participated in a program to test the vaccine. Now, her wild relatives may have a better life because of the research that involved Joy.",

        "Description_full": "In the 18th century, Edgefield County had largely a subsistence economy in which the settlers consumed what they raised. Beginning around 1800, following the invention of the cotton gin, planters began to grow cotton, which became an extremely profitable cash crop. During the antebellum period, \"King Cotton\" created a Plantation Society based upon slave labor. The wealthiest planters erected imposing homes both on their plantations and in the Village of Edgefield. After the War Between the States, cotton production continued to increase sharply until the early 1920's. Edgefield County, like most of the South, became a \"one-crop\"economy, in which all life revolved around the cultivation of cotton. In the early 1920's, the boll weevil arrived in Edgefield County devastating cotton yields. This tiny insect triggered an extended decline in cotton production, causing a dramatic outmigration from the county's farms and depressing the local economy for nearly half a century. Although peaches have been grown in Edgefield County since the 18th century, the first commercial crop was produced by William Gregg in the 1850's. With the decline of cotton in the 1930's, a number of farmers on \"The Ridge\" began to cultivate peaches on a commercial scale. By the late 1960's Edgefield County's peach production had become nationally significant. Forestry has always been an important part of the county's economy. In the period after the decline of cotton, hundreds of thousands of acres in Edgefield County returned to woodlands, much of it for the commercial production of pine trees.",

It served the needs of the people as the public library and, when the library moved to its current home, it became the Museum you see here now. It chronicles the good times and the bad - a tribute to life in Aiken. Life in Aiken took a radical change in November of 1950 when the announcement was made of the Savannah River Plant - the \"Bomb Plant\" being built. Change occurred overnight.

He moved to Virginia in 1772. At the outbreak of the Revolution, he was commissioned a brigadier general and helped organize the American army at Boston. In 1777 Gates commanded the American forces that defeated and captured General John Burgoyne�s British army at Saratoga, New York. Congress appointed him to replace Benjamin Lincoln as commander in the South after the surrender of Charleston in 1780. Gate�s attempt to force the British out of Camden resulted in a disastrous defeat on August 16, 1780, and he was removed from command. Major General Baron Johann de Kalb (1721-1780) De Kalb was the son of Bavarian peasants. He joined the French army and served with distinction in the War of the Austrian Succession (1744-1748) and Seven Years� War (1756-1763), earning promotions and the title of &amp;#8220;baron&amp;#8221;. De Kalb came to America in 1777 with his friend the Marquis de Lafayette. Congress appointed him a major general, and he served under General George Washington at Valley Forge. He took command of reinforcements sent to the South in 1780, and fought heroically at the Battle of Camden, where he was mortally wounded. Major General Nathanael Greene (1742-1786) A native of Rhode Island, Greene took command of his state�s troops in May 1775 during the siege of Boston. He subsequently became a general in the Continental Army. Greene served in the 1776 New York and New Jersey campaigns, and the Pennsylvania campaign of 1777. In 1778 he was appointed quartermaster general of the northern army. After the American defeat at Camden in August 1780, General George Washington chose Greene to replace Horatio Gates as commander in the South. Greene took charge in December, and after ten months of hard campaigning he drove the British from the interior of Georgia and the Carolinas. He then encircled Charleston and Savannah until British forces evacuated these towns in 1782.",

Dr.Uzal Johnson of the New Jersey provincials spent the night with the several hundred men with wounds, tending friend and foe alike. At dawn, a long line of prisoners stumbled away under guard.In a few weeks, some would be paroled. Many would escape and return to the King's ranks. A few, judged notorious plunderers, would be hanged. And none would see themselves or the King's cause as they had before Kings Mountain.Nor would their leaders in London.Tories After the WarAs the war ended in 1783, each loyalist American had to make a decision. Many, like Abraham DePeyster, left to resettle in New Brunswick, Canada. His family lost all their properties in New York.Other Tories, like the 23-year-old Dr. Johnson, chose to return home and resume their lives among their neighbors under a new government.",

Ammons reenlisted in 1777, and was in the battles of Savannah and Stono Ferry and the Siege of Savannah in 1777-1779. (Reverse) Ammons, captured by the British at the fall of Charleston in 1780, was exchanged in time for the siege of Yorktown and the British surrender there in 1781. An early history of Marlboro County praised him for his &amp;#8220;great firmness of character and solid worth.&amp;#8221; Ammons, a longtime member of Beauty Spot Baptist Church, received a veteran�s pension shortly before his death in 1833.",

Let the truthful and impartial historian tell! Let him record how they wrestled victory from foes who far surpassed them in numbers, in excellence of arms and equipment, and in all the provisions and munitions of war, and who supported by the material, moral, and political power of almost the entire civilized world. Let him record with what courage they met death and danger, with what fortitude they endured sickness and imprisonment, with what unflagging cheerfulness they sustained privations and suffering. And above all let him record with what sublime endurance they met defeat, and how in poverty and want, broken in health, but not in spirit, they have re-created the greatness of the south and made it again the sweetest land on earth. In grateful acknowledgement of their prowess in war, and of their achievements in peace, this monument is erected, that it may teach the generations of the future the story of the matchless, unfading, and undying honor which the Confederate Soldier won.",

        "Description_full": " The location of the Anderson County Courthouse Annex on the corner of Fant and River Street has unique significance to Anderson's history. The site is the location of the 1865 federal encampment of the First Maine, 33rd Regiment, United States Colored Troops (USCT), a military unit composed of African American soldiers. The encampment included the terrain where historic McCant's Middle School now stands, continuing to the corner of Fant and River Streets. The First Marine troops, 33rd Regiment consisted of freed men under the command of white officers. The officers were housed at the Benson Hotel in town and eventually, the soldiers were garrisoned at Johnson Female University. During a period of time directly after the ending of the Civil War, Anderson had African American troops garrisoned to maintain law and order. This era was referred to as \"Presidential Reconstruction.\" It began with the surrender of the Confederate government and ended with the Congressional Reconstruction. The era reflected the lawlessness of the time period when the story of Anderson County native Manse Jolly, a returning veteran of Company F, First SC Calvary, grew to be a South Carolina legend when his bold escapes of revenge against Union forces. Manse Jolly left Anderson County to start a new life in Milam County, Texas, and died in a flooded river. Very few references regarding the occupation exist; however, the diaries of Andersonian Emmala Reed give a view of occupied Anderson in this period. Emmala wrote \"my alma mater (Johnson University), now sold by our vile Maine garrison - as a Yankee hospital - desecrated.\" Another source are the papers of Lt. Col. Charles Taylor Trowbridge, who was the commander of the First Maine, 33rd Regiment, USCT, who were stationed in Anderson on August 14, 1865. Colonel Trowbridge faced many challenges to restore order in the three counties of Pickens, Oconee, and Anderson, and survived several close encounters with Manse Jolly, who threatened to kill him. The First Maine left Anderson in September 1865.",

The plant, in McFall's Mill at High Shoals on the Rocky River 6 mi. E, supplied power to light the city and also operated several small industries in Anderson. In 1897 Whitner replaced the Reverse: experimental plant with a larger generating station at Portman Shoals 11 mi. W on the Seneca River. The extra power from this plant powered Anderson Cotton Mills and a streetcar line which was the forerunner of the Piedmont &amp; Northern RR. Both plants pioneered in transmitting high voltage electricity direct from the station switchboard. This innovation helped spur the modern industrialization of the Southeast.",

The District's Roots Prior to Euro-America settlement, Cherokee and other Native-American peoples lived in this area. Public acquisition of these lands started with a purchase from John Lochrie on march 10, 1917. The largest tract purchased to date was from the Oconee Timber Company in the late 1920s totaling more than 17,000 acres. This area was originally part of the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Francis Marion and Sumter National Forests in South Carolina in 1936. Much of the area had been cleared and farmed prior to Forest Service acquisition. efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant and stabilize cleared lands and construct roads and facilities in those early years have helped to shape the forest into the treasure it is today. Linking the Future to the Past Current management by the Forest Service emphasizes the restoration and maintenance of forest ecosystems and processes that existed in these foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains prior to European settlement. Efforts include management for plant and animal species that have become threatened or in danger of extinction due to loss of native habitats.

        "Description_full": "Settlers from the Waccamaw Neck attempted to extend thei plantations to what was called Long Bay. Many families received land in 1735 just south of the Withers Swash when the colonial government began issuing grants. Independent farmers and fisherman began settling in the area. The farms were small and self-contained. Families that farmed or fished in the area included names such as Todd, Stalvey, Owens, Anderson, King, Simmons and DuBois. In the nineteenth century, many of the settlers were involved in the naval stores and timber industries. Many farmers who could not afford the taxes offered to sell their property to the timber and turpentine dealers. Many of the dealers including the Burroughs and Collins firm acquired large tracts of land along the coast. In the early part of the 20th century, the company shifted from timber and turpentine to farming. In 1912, a northern financier by the name of Simeon B. Chapin met with the Burroughs brothers and entered into a partnership which became Myrtle Beach Farms Company. Decades later, on October 16, 1939, the Myrtle Beach Town Council resolved that the town &amp;#8220;is in dire need of a modern municipal airport&amp;#8221; and agreed to purchase 135 acres for that purpose from Myrtle Beach Farms Company, Inc., at a price of $35 per acre. Two weeks later Council named the soon-to-be-built airport \"Harrelson Municipal Airport in recognition of Mayor W. L. Harrelson's support of the project. Lewis, Catherine H., Horry County, South Carolina 1730 &amp;#8211; 1993, University of South Carolina Press, 1998 City of Myrtle Beach Mayor W. L. Harrelson ( adjacent marker ) Archaeological and Historical Data This area has a rich history, including the many different land uses along the coastal strand from the prehistoric period into the 21st century. An archaeological study of the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base conducted in the 1980s by Carolina Archaeological Services (now AF Consultants) of Columbia, South Carolina, found the earliest settlers included Early to Middle Woodland prehistoric Indian campsites (about 3,000 years ago) and tenant farms (about 130 years ago) and military occupations. History tells us that the Spanish explorer Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon explored the South Carolina coast in the sixteenth century. About 150 years later, English settlers found their way to the Carolina coast where the Waccamaw, Pee Dee, Winyah, Socastee, Wampee and Waccawache native Americans lived. Less than a century after the arrival of the European settlers, the native American tribes disappeared.

Banding (heating and tightening bands of wrought iron around a cast iron barrel) strengthened a cannon to withstand increased pressure created by greater powder charges. Rifling (cutting spiral grooves in a weapon's bore) gave a stabilizing spin to a projectile, increasing accuracy.Rifled cannon had greater range than smoothbores of similar size. Their elongated aerodynamically-shaped projectiles could be larger and heavier, and were more accurate and destructive than the old, round shot and shells. They could be either solid shot or filled with explosives.If you look into the cannon barrels here, you can see that some are smoothbores and some are rifled.(Sidebar):Fort Sumter's original armament consisted of cast iron smoothbore guns which were mounted \"en barbette\" on the parapet and in the first tier of the casemates.The recoil of the wooden carriages allowed the crew to service these muzzle-loading guns. A 42-pounder smoothbore cannon is located near the fort entrance.",

Following the Civil War, the neighborhood became popular with middle-class African Americans, including noted photographer Richard Samuel Roberts.

John Ashley and then Elijah Willis owned this land before 1850: the house was likely built by the Ashley family. Williston, chartered in 1858, was named for the Willis family, which gave land for a depot on the S.C. Rail Road, for a church (now First Baptist Church), and for a school. (Marker Reverse) The town's oldest house occupies a prominent location between the S.C. Rail Road and the Augusta Charleston Road. As W.T. Sherman's Federal army advanced through the area on February 8-9, 1865, Gen. Judson Kilpatrick used this house as his headquarters before burning most of the town and proceeding to Aiken and Columbia. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.",

Most were Scotch-Irish, but with English, German, French, Swiss, Irish, and Africans among them. Many early settlers received land by a grant from Great Britain in the name of King George II. In order to secure ownership of the granted land, the new owners were required to build a permanent shelter on the land. This Backwoods Cabin represents the first home on the Carolina frontier - simple and unrefined, sturdy and easily built. Often the cabin was not meant to be permanent. Instead it was intended as a first step toward their goal of becoming self-reliant members of a stable agricultural community. Farming was the key to this stability. Clearing the forests for crops was the first fundamental environmental change in the region and the first significant mark of settlement.",

Lowe (1832-1913) landed the Enterprise, a large gas balloon, on a nearby farm. Lowe was on a test flight in preparation for a trans-Atlantic attempt. Southeasterly currents had carried him 800-900 miles by air from Cincinnati to Union District in less than nine hours. [Reverse]: Many locals assumed that Lowe was a Yankee spy, and it was difficult for him to convince them that he was not. He was taken to Union and spent the night there under guard. Taken to Columbia, he was allowed to return north by train after several gentlemen vouched for his reputation as a scientist. Lowe later founded and directed a balloon corps in the U.S. Army in Virginia 1861-1863.",

S.C. Canal &amp; Railroad Company Built in the early 1830's, the South Carolina Canal and Railroad line passed through the area on its way to Hamburg. Local landowners donated the property needed for the railroad right of way. The village, which would later be called Bamberg, developed with the railroad and was chartered in 1855. The railroad line was the longest in the world at the time of its construction spanning 137 miles of roadbed and rail. It was the first railroad to offer scheduled passenger service and carry mail.(Picture included)In 1970 the Charleston to Hamburg railroad was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Once home to the oldest railroad line, today it is a city owned walking trail. Bamberg &amp; the Civil War Bamberg, then part of the Old Barnwell District, was the home to three signers of the Ordinance of Session from the Union and the President of the Secession Convention. David Flavel Jamison served as President of the Secession Convention and owned a local plantation. Jamison died before the conclusion of the War Between the States and prior to General William T. Sherman's Carolinas Campaign. However, due to his involvement with the secessionist movement, Gen. Sherman ordered the Jamison Plantation destroyed. Major General William T. Sherman's Carolina Campaign was especially destructive in Bamberg. Sherman tore up the railroad ties that were so vital to the economy of the town and most of the antebellum structures were destroyed. Bamberg paid dearly for being the hometown of three signers' of the Ordinance of Session. The Simmons House is one of the few antebellum structures that survived and can be seen today.(Pictures included) David Flavel Jamison (1810-1864), President of the secession Convention Major General William T.

Later, during the 1st Marine Division's historic retrograde from the Chosin Reservoir, he earned a Navy Cross for multiple actions near Koto-Ri. During 1968 and 1969 he commanded the 9th Marine Regiment in numerous combat actions in Vietnam including Operation Dewey Canyon, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the U.S. Army.

In his most senior headquarters assignments, he served as the deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, and as the Assistant Commandant prior to be nominated as the 27th Commandant of the Marine Corps. General Barrow was the first Commandant to serve a regular four-year tour as a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1979 to 1983). He ensured the success of the Corps' transition to an all- volunteer force by raising education standards and focusing the Corps on retaining quality individuals through professional education. He was also instrumental in bringing positive changes to recruit training. General Barrow's talent, vision, and leadership positioned the Marine Corps to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.

As the enemy drew near, Moultrie was about to send an aide to pull these troops back to the main force when Col. John Laurens offered to lead them back. Moultrie had so much confidence in the officer that he sent along 250 men to help cover the flanks, In direct disobedience of orders Laurens crossed the river and formed the men in line for battle. He failed to take the high ground and his men suffered greatly from well-placed enemy fire.

Here two almost evenly matched armies slugged it out in the last major Revolutionary War battle in South Carolina. In over three hours of brutal combat, American and British forces traded musket volleys and bayonet charges. Greene's troops drove the British back into their camp, but the British regrouped and forced Greene from the battlefield. The Americans suffered more than 500 casualties, but the British lost nearly 700. Crippled by the loss of almost a third of his command, Stewart retreated toward Charleston the following day, leaving most of the South Carolina countryside in American control.( Reverse text) A Close and Deadly Clash of Veteran Troops Greene's army at Eutaw Springs consisted of regular soldiers and malitia, or part-time citizen soldiers. Stewart's force was composed of British regulars and Loyalists, Americans fighting to preserve British rule. Each army mustered about 2000 men, most of them veterans. Infantry- foot soldiers carrying single-shot, muzzle loading- muskets formed the bulk of both forces. Maneuvering in close ranks, they fired their muskets in short-ranged volleys and then charged with bayonets. Several small cannons supported both armies in the front lines. Small reserves of cavalry forces waited to exploit breakthroughs or cover retreats. While mounted, the cavalrymen fought mostly with heavy sabers. These tactics and weapons ensured that the opposing forces at Eutaw Springs would clash at close, deadly range.",

        "Name": "Battle of Port Royal",
        "Description_full": "On the morning of November 7, 1861, Du Pont's flagship, the Wabash led the fleet into action. As the Union vessels near the sound Confederate batteries at Forts Walker and Beauregard opened fire. Du Pont, having sent ships to test the enemy's capabilities the day before, concentrated most of his fire on the more heavily armed Fort Walker. For several hours Union warships dueled the Confederate forts. Shells ripped through Fort Walker, dismounting guns, and killing or wounding some of the garrison. Though valiantly served, the Confederate guns did little harm to the constantly moving ships. Cutting the Lifeline At the outset of the Civil War, Federal strategists knew that a naval blockade of southern ports was crucial to stop the influx of supplies from abroad which the South depended upon to conduct war. It would also slow the exportation of goods funding the South.Situated between the seaports of Savannah and Charleston, Port Royal Sound was an excellent base from which to carry out a naval blockade. Confederate planners knew the importance of Port Royal Sound. To defend it they constructed two large, earthern forts at its entrance; Fort Walker on Hilton Head Island and Fort Beauregard on Bay Point. Combined they mounted nearly 50 guns. [ Picture included : Fort Beauregard Bay Point and Fort Walker Hilton Head Island ] A Difficult Passage [ Pictures included ] On October 29, 1861 the largest fleet yet assembled by the United States, under the command of Flag Officer Samuel F. Du Pont, set sail from Hampton Roads, Virginia. Nearly 13,000 soldiers and Marines accompanied the 17 warships, 25 coaling schooners and 33 transports, but their destination had been kept secret.Three days out to sea, a tremendous gale off Cape Hatteras scattered the fleet and four ships were lost. Opening sealed orders provided in the event the convoy was dispersed, each vessel plotted its own course to a rendezvous point off Port Royal Sound. By November 3, the majority of the squadron had arrived. Preparing the Attack As the Union fleet assembled, it was first challenged by four Confederate vessels commanded by Josiah Tattnall. Vastly out-armed, the Southern gunboats continued to contest the advance Union warships for two days while Du Pont positioned the fleet against General Thomas Drayton's coastal fortifications. Du Pont's innovative plan divided his warships into two parallel squadrons. The vessels would sail into Port Royal Sound between two enemy forts. Once past the defenses, one column would guard against Confederate gunboats while the other circled back in an elliptical maneuver, bombarding the forts into submission. [ Picture included ] [Other Pictures include: Wabash, Du Pont's flagship, Susquehanna,Mohican, Pawnee, Unadilla, Bienville, Augusta, Pocahontas, also Samuel F. Du Pont,Commadore Percival Drayton.and General Thomas Drayton ]Brother Against Brother In a war of divided loyalties, sometimes brother did face brother in battle. Thomas Drayton's younger brother, Percival Drayton, commanded the Pocahontas, which fired more than 70 rounds in one hour at his brother's troops on shore. Confederate Colonel John A. Wagener described the battle from his vantage point at Fort Walker: [ Picture included ]The enemy had chosen a day which was entirely propitious to him. The water was smooth as glass. The air was just sufficient to blow the smoke of his guns into our faces, where it would meet the column of our own smoke and prevent our sight excepting by glimpses. No sooner did we obtain his range when it would be changed, and time after time rechanged, while the deep water permitted him to choose his own position and fire shot after shot and shell after shell with the precision of target practice.Southern resistance continued until mid afternoon when their ammunition ran low, and little damage had been inflicted on the attacking fleet. With many of their guns dismounted, and in danger of being trapped. the decision was made to abandon Forts Walker and Beauregard and retreat inland. Port Royal Sound had been secured by the Union.For the remainder of the war the area served as Union headquarters for the army's Department of the South and navy's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which patrolled the South Carolina, Georgia and east Florida coast.",

        "Description_full": "The Story of the WaxhawsImmediately after the engagement, reports spread that many were stabbed and killed as they tried to surrender. Many were taken to a local Presbyterian church where local residents cared for them, including a young Andrew Jackson and his mother. Banastre Tarleton was denounced and over time became known as \"Bloody Ban the Butcher\" for his actions on the battlefield. In his report to the Virginia Assembly, Colonel Buford confirmed that \"Our loss is very great � many of which (were) killed after they had laid down their arms.\" For his part, Tarleton acknowledged an erroneous report that he had been slain \"stimulated the soldiers to a vindictive asperity not easily restrained.\" While historians continue to debate the events that occurred at the Waxhaws, it is clear that Tarleton's actions, here and elsewhere, stirred and angered the backcountry settlers into action.The Spark to IndependenceAfter the surrender of Charleston in May 1780, all organized Patriot resistance in the South was nearly extinguished. However, the British followed their victory with heavy-handed treatment of the rural population. General Clinton proclaimed that those who did not take an oath to the King would be treated as \"rebels and enemies to their country.\" None could remain neutral. Throughout the Carolinas, the conflict disintegrated into terrible civil war. Loyalists sought vengeance on their beaten Patriot neighbors. Patriot militia rallied and treated Loyalists in a like manner. As the British Legion burned and pillaged the countryside, stories were told and retold of the slaughter at the Waxhaws. Indeed, the phrase \"Tarleton's Quarter\" became synonymous with cruel treatment and the execution of prisoners.",

The long-fibered \"Sea Island Cotton\" recovered and continued to support the economy. The coming of the boll weevil, some sixty years later, banished cotton forever from the sea islands. In 1892 a great storm came ashore at the high tide, piling water on water until the islands were swept clean of agriculture and shipping. Thousands drowned.Now, where rice, indigo and cotton once flourished, cattle, feed crops, vegetables and soybeans grow. A fishing fleet \" drags\" the local waters for shrimp.

Early in that year the first British attempt to take the town was repulsed by General William Moultrie's Militia at the Battle of Port Royal Island. The same year Beaufort was occupied by British forces. Patriots and Tories fought bitterly throughout the area to the end of 1782. Beaufort's most prominent patriot was Thomas Heyward Jr., signer of the Declaration of Independence. After slow recovery from the war's depletion, the introduction of sea island cotton in 1799 brought a rapid increase in plantations and slaves. New wealth provided Beaufort's elegant homes, fine libraries and some of the best preparatory schools in the south between 1800 and 1860, including Beaufort College. So many men of the state and national prominence were produces that ante-bellum Beaufort was described as the \"wealthiest, most aristocratic and cultivating town of its size in America.\" It was an economy based upon cotton undergirded by slavery.",

        "Description_full": "In 1520 the Spaniard, Francisco Gordillo, sailing from Hispaniola, stopped near Port Royal Sound long enough to call the place Santa Elena. Fourty-two years later, in 1562, Jean Ribaut and his French Huguenots named the region Port Royal and attempted a colony on Parris Island. It survived a year.       Alarmed by the French intrusion, the Spanish in 1566, built Fort San Phillipe which was destroyed following an Indian massacre and replaced by the larger San Marcos in 1577.       In 1586 St. Augustine was burned by the English Privateer, Sir Francis Drake, forcing the withdrawal of the Spanish from Port Royal. The Spanish maintained their claim, however, and a hundred years later destroyed the fledging Scottish Colony of Lord Cardross at Spanish Point.       The English explored Port Royal Sound in 1663 under Captain William Hilton followed by Robert Sanford in 1666. Sanford left Dr. Henry Woodward at Port Royal to establish trade with the Indians. By 1700 English planters and traders had established a foothold in the area but the Spanish threat discouraged a permanent settlement. In 1711 Beaufort was founded and named for Henry Somerset, Duke of Beaufort. Thomas Nairn of St. Helena's Island and John Barnwell of Port Royal were most responsible for establishing a new town.       Easter Sunday, 1715, the Yemassee and Creek Indians attacked and burned Beaufort, massacring many settlers. Others escaped to a ship anchored in the river. The Militia was rallied and assisted Governor Craven in driving the Yemassee into Florida, from where they raided the sea islands until 1728.",

        "Name": "Beaufort South Carolina Tricentennial 1711-2011",
        "Description_full": "We celebrate and recognize the proud citizens who gave generously to create and erect these monuments to honor Beaufort's 300th Birthday January 17th 2011. (Plaque 1)    Prior to the founding of Beaufort, the Spanish, French and English explored this coast. Spanish voyages in 1514, 1521, 1525 and 1526 led to the lost Spanish City of San Miguel de Gualdape. In 1525, Spanish Captain Pedro de Quexos named the region Santa Elana, one of the oldest European place names in North America.    In 1582, French Captain Jean Ribault arrived and renamed the sound Port Royal, the deepest natural harbor south of New York. On what is now Parris Island to the south, Ribault established the first protestant colony in the New World calling it Charlesfort. It was abandoned in 1563.    In 1566, the Spanish returned, led by Pedro Menendez de Aviles who established La Cuidad de Santa Elana at the Charlesfort site and created the first official capital of Florida. The capital was moved to St. Augustine in 1574. Santa Elana was the northern bastion of Spanish Florida until it was abandoned in 1587.    English Captain William Hilton arrived from Barbados in 1663. Colonel Robert Sandford followed in 1666, leaving behind Dr. Henry Woodward who thus became the first permannent English settler in South Carolina.    In 1685, Scottish settlers led by Lord Cardross established Stuart Town, up river from Charlesfort. It was destroyed by a Spanish Army in 1686. By 1698 the first English Land Grants were givrn to Scottish Indian traders John Stewart and Thomas Nairne. Rivalry with Spanish Florida continued for the next 67 years. (Plaque 2)       Rivalry with Spanish Florida resulted in the founding of Beaufort. Queen Anne's war (1702-1713) prompted an attack by the Carolinians on St. Augustine in 1702 led by Colonel James Moore's army assembled at Port Royal Island. The attack on St. Augustine failed, but on their return they left an outpost here. By 1706, the Beaufort Outpost had become a log block house and palisade with a garrison of British Redcoats. The town grew around the fort with Indian trade in deerskins as the first commerce.    In 1709, the traders petitioned the Lords Proprietors of Carolina to establish a town. On January 17, 1711, the charter for the town of Beaufort, then the second oldest town in South Carolina, was issued. It was named for Henry Somerset, Duke of Beaufort, one of the Lords Proprietors. In 1717 Beaufort's streets were laid out and named. Town lots were granted at the time.    Two of the town's founders and first settlers were Captain Thomas Nairne and Colonel John \"Tuscarora Jack\" Barnwell. (Plaque 3)    This early settlement was destroyed by the Yemassee Indians on April 15, 1715. The Yemassee War (1715-1728) depopulated the frontier and drove the Yemassee to Florida where they merged with the Seminoles. Thomas Nairne was killed in the first massacre. Colonel \"Tuscarora Jack\" Barnwell was one of the heroes of the war, which ended the Indian trade and Indian habitation of the lowcountry.    The Plantation Era followed the retreat of the Yemassee. Cattle thrived on the Sea Islands and on the mainland where an open range prompted branding of cattle and the development of \"cowpens\" in the pine forests.    Rice was introduced from West Africa in the 1730s and large plantations developed among the freshwater swamps and tidal creeks. In the 1740s, Indigo was introduced to the Sea Islands. This prompted the importation of tens of thousands of African slaves.    Colonial wars with Spanish Florida and years of pirate raids slowed the growth of the town until the British acquired Florida in 1763. (Plaque 4) The decade before the Revolutionary War was a very prosperous time with cattle, rice, and indiago and a thriving local ship building industry utilizing the abundant Live-Oak timber.    Political strife with Great Britian prompted Royal Governor Charles Montague to move the capital from Charleston to Beaufort on October 8, 1772. His attempt to bully the King failed. The capital was moved back to Charleston after two days, prompting Thomas Heyward, Jr. to enter politics at the Beaufort assembly. He later signed the Declaration of Independence for South Carolina, and moving the Beaufort Assembly is listed as a grievance in the Declaration of Independence.    Beaufort was divided by the Revolutionary War. Friends, neighbors and relatives fought each other as Tories and Patriots. British invasions in 1779 and 1780 halted commerce, destroyed property and kidnapped thousands of slaves. British General Augustine Provost's troops burned Prince William Parish Church in Sheldon in 1779. Colonel Banastre Tarleton's troops stole all the horses on Port Royal Island. When the Treaty of Paris recognized American Independence in 1783, Beaufort had to rebuild after eight years of war. (Plaque 5)    The Antebellum Era was known as the \"Periclean Age\" of Beaufort. Great wealth from Sea Island cotton and \"Carolina Gold\" rice made Beaufort one of the wealthiest towns in America. Large summer villas were built along Bay Street and throughout the old town. Beaufort College was chartered in 1795, the Beaufort Library Society was founded in 1803, and a female seminary was added in the 1850s. On December 17, 1803, the town of Beaufort was incorporated. The first municipal government was an intendant and six wardens. Beaufort produced political and intellectual leaders of the Old South, including Senator Robert W. Barnwell, poet William J. Grayson, and writer William Elliott, III.    In 1819, Beaufort was connected to the outside world by regular steamboat packets between Charleston and Savannah. President James Monroe visited in 1819, and the Marquis de Lafayette was entertained here in 1825. The wealth of antebellum Beaufort was based on the value and labor of slaves. In 1850, the Sea Islands had 1,111 white people and 8,361 slaves occupying 151 plantations.    Before the Civil War, Beaufort's planters were leading defenders of slavery and Southern rights. A Beaufort native, Senator Robert Barnwell Rhett, became South Carolina's \"Father of Secession.\" This region led the state into secession, and South Carolina led the South out of the Union. The Civil War ensued. (Plaque 6)    The Civil War began in Charleston Harbor in April, 1861. Seven months later on November 7, 1861, a huge Union fleet steamed into Port Royal Sound, subdued the Confederate forts on Hilton Head and Bay Point, and occupied Beaufort and the Sea Islands. The Sea Islands remained in Union control throughout the war. The wealthy planter families evacuated, leaving behind nearly 10,000 slaves. In 1862, numerous religious and charitable groups came to Beaufort to educate the former slaves and prepare them for emancipation. Penn School, founded by Laura Towne on St. Helena Island in 1862, is one of the oldest Freedmen Schools in America. These Philanthropic efforts were called \"The Port Royal Experiment.\" Beaufort became a headquarters and hospital community for the U.S. Army. On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was issued and the Sea Island slaves became among the first freedmen in America. Thousands of African American soldiers were recruited into the U.S. Army to fight for their own freedom. General William Tecumseh Sherman arrived in Beaufort in January, 1865. On April 26, 1865, the Civil War ended. By then, Beaufort and the Sea Islands had become a colony of African American freedmen and northern merchants. The Civil War totally transformed Beaufort. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution ended slavery, guaranteed civil rights, and gave the vote to the freedmen. Beaufort's African American majority controlled politics for three decades. The political leader of Beaufort was Robert Smalls, former slave, Civil War hero, and five-term U.S. Congressman. Reconstruction Beaufort was also transformed from a plantation economy to a commercial and industrial economy. In 1873, the Port Royal and Augusta Railroad connected Port Royal Island to the mainland for the first time. The railroad delivered coal and Trans-Atlantic steamships frequented Port Royal Sound. In 1877, the U.S. Navy established a coaling station and bought land on Parris Island. Phosphate rock was discovered on the river bottoms and from 1870 to 1893, Beaufort County was the leading domestic source of phosphates, providing 3,000 local jobs. The commercial and industrial leader of reconstruction Beaufort was Duncan Campbell Wilson, a native of Greenock, Scotland. (Tablet 7)    On August 27, 1893, one of the deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history struck Beaufort. Most of the Sea Islands were inundated. The phosphate works were completely destroyed. Nearly 2000 people were drowned. The course of Beaufort's history was changed.    The phosphate industry went into rapid decline and was gone by 1914. The Port Royal and Augusta Railroad went bankrupt and was merged with the Charleston and Western Carolina Line in 1896. The U.S. Navy abandoned their coaling station and dry dock in 1901. The maritime traffic slowed to a trickle, and the Port of Beaufort was officially closed in 1933.    The cotton industry was unprofitable for fifteen years before World War I. In 1917, the Boll Weevil appeared in Beaufort County and by 1920, cotton was gone. Vegetable farming replaced cotton for a few farmers, but the principal pillars of the reconstruction economy disappeared by the 1920s. The Beaufort Bank failed in 1926.    The South Carolina Constitution of 1895 imposed \"Jim Crow\" laws on Beaufort County. The African American Republican Ascendancy of Reconstruction was replaced by white democratic political dominance.    Massive outmigration resulted in Beaufort County's population declining by 38% between 1890 and 1940. Over half of the African American population moved away. By 1960, there was a white majority for the first time in Beaufort's history. By the 1930s, Beaufort County was one of the poorest places in America. (Plaque 8)    Despite the long depression, progress was made in transportation and education. Automobile travel prompted highway construction. Bridges built across Whale Branch River in 1908 and the Beaufort River in 1927 connected the Sea Islands to the mainland. Beaufort High School for whites was opened in 1909 and Robert Smalls High School for African Americans was opened in 1919.    The U.S. Marine Corps commissioned the Parris Island Recruit Depot in 1915. Seventy percent of the Marines who served in France in World War I were trained on Parris Island.    In 1938, the U.S. military build-up for World War II began. Large construction contracts on Parris Island provided jobs for much of the region. Marine Corps training doubled in 1941. After Pearl Harbor, Parris Island became the largest population in Beaufort County. During World War II, 241,000 Marines completed boot camp on Parris Island, ten times the total population of Beaufort County in 1940. In 1943, the U.S. Navy opened the Naval Air Station north of Beaufort. The Naval Air Station was decommissioned in 1946.    During World War II, Beaufort was a boom town. Jobs and prosperity overcame the poverty of the 1930s. World War II and the U.S. Marine Corps began Beaufort's post-war prosperity. (Plaque 9)  The Marine Corps build-up continued with the advent of the Korean War, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War. In 1955, the Naval Air Station was recommissioned as the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort.     In 1956, a new toll bridge was built to Hilton Head Island. Beach and golf resorts followed. In 1957, the Broad River Bridge opened, linking the two halves of the county. A Real Estate boom begun then has continued for over fifty years. Beaufort County became the fastest growing and richest per capita county in the state.    Beginning in 1949, the U.S. Marine Corps racially integrated its training and operations, and in 1970, Beaufort County Public Schools fully integrated. Modern Beaufort outgrew the legacy of the segregated South.    In 1974, the Waterfront Park was opened. In 1973, Historic Beaufort was designated as a National Historic Landmark District. The 300 year old town became a magnet for tourists, artists, writers and movie-makers.",

        "Description_full": "Beaver (Castor canadensis) inhabited the Conestee area long before the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century. Their numerous dams throughout the Park have inundated much of the former lake bed, creating wetlands which provide habitat for wildlife and filtration to purify the waters of the streams and creeks flowing into the Park. Animals dependent on these wetlands include muskrats, river otters, turtles, frogs, water snakes, fish, dukes, geese, herons, and other birds. A careful observer can also see other signs of beaver activity near the trails along the wetlands, such as stumps of beaver gnaw marks. the \"skeletons\" of dead trees in the wetlands indicate that the beaver dams have flooded former bottomland forests, drowning the tree roots and killing the trees. Beavers live in mud and branch lodges located in or at the edge of their ponds. Lodge entrances are generally under water to provide protection from predators. Some beaver dams in the Park are hundreds of feet long and raise the pond level behind the dam as much as 3 feet. Like the lodges, the dams are constructed of sticks and small trees harvested by the beavers and bound solidly together with mud. Beaver can grow to a length of approximately 4 feet, including their broad flat tails, and can weigh more than 50 lbs. Mating for life, both parents care for the one to four young (kits) that are born in the spring. They are nocturnal animals, working and feeding at night; therefore, they are rarely seen during the day.",

        "Description_full": "Belton The Tennis Capital of South Carolina Tennis Anyone? Long know as the Tennis Capital of South Carolina, Belton's tennis history can be traced back over 110 years. An 1892 edition of the Anderson Intelligencer stated, \"The young men of Belton are happy. The stores close at 6:00 and the clerks have an opportunity to engage in lawn tennis.\" Belton's first court was located in the triangle formed by the railroad tracks near the depot and later the famous Town Court stood where the Belton Tennis Center is located today. Tennis began to really catch on in Belton during the time between the two world wars. Belton's youth dominated play and produced many state high school champions. The high school girl's team did not lose a match for 14 straight years. The formation of the Belton Tennis Association combined with the number of public and private courts enabled the town to become the home of the Palmetto Tennis Championships in 1957. Belton girls sparkled in the early days of the Palmetto and won many titles in the 50s and 60s. The girl's high school team won 9 straight state championships between 1958 and 1967. During the 1970s the Palmetto Championship became the state's national junior qualifying tournament. The 80s saw a major addition to the Belton tennis scene, the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame, located in the Belton Depot. The Hall of Fame showcases portraits and memorabilia of South Carolina's greatest tennis championships and volunteers. Belton tennis continued to flourish over the years. The Hall of Fame Classic, the state's top high school girls tournament, was started in 1987. The Belton Tennis Center was expanded in the early 90s, the Palmetto Championships grew and prosperous, and local players and teams continued to win championships. Providing decades of the state's best junior tennis is a proud local tradition. Belton tennis provides a sense of place that may be best described by a tennis pro as he watched a young player compete in the Palmetto: \"The sweet smell and feeling of this match reminds me what is good about learning to enjoy tennis. What is good is that it happens to you. You become a player. You become someone with a chance of winning a match. You become someone with a history...you become someone who had played Belton!\" Historic Belton Child of the Railroad Origins The town of Belton was chartered in 1855 as a \"child of the railroad.\" Judge John \"Belton\" O'Neal and a group of prominent leaders of South Carolina formed the Columbia and greenville Railroad Company to connect Charleston with Cincinnati by way of the Blue Ridge Railway. Work on this project began in 1847 and it soon became evident that the company could save $100,000 by following a path west of the Saluda River, crossing near Pelzer near Greenville. This met with extreme opposition from the Anderson stockholders. In order to retain their financial support, it was decided that a spur line be run from the courthouse at Anderson to connect with the regular line at Sugar Hill (now called Belton). This would take place on the property owned by Dr. George Brown who also donated land for the depot and town square. The decision to form this rail line sparked interest in many to locate to this junction and, thus, Belton was born. Belton Depot Built in 1906, the depot once served two rail lines. The tracks for both lines are still intact. Although the Piedmont &amp; Northern closed down, the Columbia and Greenville, now called the Pickens Railroad, is still in use. Visitors to Belton still near an occasional train's whistle. Today the renovated depot houses the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame and Belton's history museum, the Ruth Drake Museum. Growth and Prosperity The railroad brought phenomenal growth. Belton now only prospered economically, but also socially. People from miles around would gather to see the trains arrive and the local hotel on the town square served hot lunches. The inviting porch of the hotel soon became the social hub of the town where people would gather to discuss the issues of the day. Geer Hotel A portion of the original hotel building still stands on Belton's historic square as Horton's Pharmacy. People from miles around would come to see the trains arrive and have lunch at the hotel. The inviting porch of the hotel soon became the social hub of the town. Tennis Courts Back in 1892, the first tennis court was located in the triangle formed by the railroad tracks. At the time, tennis was a popular leisure activity, and hotel guests and others gravitated to Belton for tennis games. Tennis remains an important part of life in Belton which more than 50 tennis courts within the city today. The city is home to the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame and the annual Palmetto Tennis Championships. Belton's Living History The first brick building on the square was built in 1877 and the second and third floors of this building became the opera house known as Stringer's Hall. The introduction of the movies established the Pastime Theater which brought the best silent movies to town. The town square also boasted a skating rink and bowling alley. Local Landmarks Many historic landmarks still stand today as reminders of Belton's rich past. One is the First Baptist Church. The first phase of the church was completed on October 11, 1861 and the beauty of its architecture can still be enjoyed today. rising above the city's skyline is the famous standpipe water tower, a landmark that can be seen for miles. The tower was built in 1908 and still stores part of the city's water supply. Living Traditions Belton's cultural history comes to life through bluegrass concerts here at the depot on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, and during the annual Standpipe Festival each fall. Local artists' work can be seen at the Belton Center for the arts located on the square.",

Brown's nephew, Dr. William Carroll Brown, was the academy's first professor. The academy stayed open during the Civil war but became a public school after it. A new frame two-story for grades 1-10 was built here in 1893. Central School The enrollment in Belton's schools grew rapidly after Belton Mill opened in 1899, and trustees approved this two-story brick school, called Central School, for grades 1-10. built in 1908, it was designed by Anderson architect Joseph H. Casey. In 1922, when a new Belton High School was built, this school became Central Grammar School, for grades 1-6. It closed in 1973, was sold to the town of Belton, and was renovated and rededicated as Belton City Hall in 1976.",

Passenger trains were discontinued in 1961 and today only one freight train, owned by the Pickens Railway Company, travels past the Depot. The Depot building has seen two renovations, one from 1980-1983, funded by concerned citizens and local businesses, and the other from 2005-2006, funded through grants from the South Carolina Highway Commission (ANATS) and Anderson County. The Depot was completely upgraded and rehabilitated and dedicated to the community in October 2006.

Hearing that British and Loyalist forces were burning the homes of Whig militiamen in Williamsburg District, Col. Marion aimed to challenge their control of the area.Marion marched his men across the Great Pee Dee and Lynches Rivers to strike at a Tory detachment at Sheppard�s Ferry on Black Mingo Creek. Stationed at Patrick Dollard�s tavern less than a mile downstream from the trading village of Willtown, some fifty Tory militiamen under the command of Capt. John Coming Ball guarded the ferry crossing.Arriving at night, Marion crossed the Black Mingo on a bridge at Willtown. The sound of the horses' hooves on the wooden planks roused the Tories, who formed a line in a clearing opposite Dollard�s tavern (located across the creek from you on the other side of the bridge). Marion divided his force into three detachments, attempting to surround them. The brief but bloody fight sent most of the Tories fleeing into the nearby swamps (behind you on this side of the creek), leaving the Whigs with a considerable store of much-needed weapons, ammunition, and horses. After the destruction of so many homes in Williamsburg, the victory at Black Mingo provided an important boost ~ practical and psychological ~ to the Patriot cause in eastern South Carolina.",

They did not want to leave their families and new financial opportunities and capture by Confederates meant a return to slavery or death. Also, many Union troops were openly hostile to escaped slaves on Hilton Head Island. To encourage recruits Gen. Hunter issued a pass to those who joined the army: Now, be it known to all from all that, agreeable to the laws, I declare the said person free and forever absolved from all claims to his services. Both he and his wife and his children have full right to go North, South, East, West, as they may decide. D. Hunter, Major General Commanding. April, 19, 1862. The unit was disbanded a few months later. Congress did not allow black men to serve until 1863 when the unit was officially organized as the First South Carolina Regiment. The men in the unit were primarily former slaves from South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Hilton Head Island and Beaufort remained focal points for organizing and stationing of freedom fighters throughout the Civil War. Fort Howell In the fall of 1864, troops in the 32nd United States Colored Infantry and the 144th New York Infantry constructed Fort Howell. This sophisticated earthwork fort was located just southwest of Mitchelville and was constructed to protect the village. Despite 150 years of erosion, the fort is still easily discernible; a testament to its engineer, Captain Charles R. Suter, and the men who labored to build it. After building the fort, the 32nd U.S. Colored Infantry participated in the Battle of Honey Hill on November 30, 1864, where they sustained fifty-one casualties. The freedom fighters of the 32nd U.S. Colored Infantry were among the 179,000 colored men in the Union Army and another 20,000 in the Navy who fought for freedom and an end to slavery during the Civil War.

They left primarily with cotton, but also carried diplomats, dispatches, and various products and valuables.The risk of capture or sinking by Union warships was great, but so were the rewards.

According to Mr. Clemson, the University would become a \"people's university,\" and open its doors of higher learning to all South Carolinians, rich and poor alike. These stone columns mark the original formal gateway to Clemson University. The original gates were constructed from field and river stone in 1915, 26 years after the founding of the land-grant institution known then as Clemson Agricultural College in November 1889. This landmark served as a meeting place for cadets and travelers throughout the decades. The columns and walls are constructed in the Arts and Crafts architectural style, a pre-World War I style which calls for a minimum of mortar, sand, and other materials. The current gates were renovated in 1932 with wash stone obtained from the Seneca River, now part of Lake Hartwell. They stand as a proud memorial of our history. Blue Key National Honor Fraternity Welcomes You to Clemson University \"Our Gates Are Always Open\" The 1995-96 and 1996-97 Blue Key National Honor Fraternity members at Clemson University proudly provided the planning, organization, and sponsorship of the Blue Key Endowment. Funds from this endowment have been used to renovate the original formal gates to Clemson University. The Blue Key Chapter represents a cross-section of the University's most outstanding students in terms of leadership, scholarship, and achievement.

To the young men and women of several generations, Booker T. Washington was the source of learning and intellectual development, a home for the greater part of the day, and a community .   The school had as great an influence on the black community as it did on its students. Concerts, dramatic presentations, operettas, and other public performances were a part of the cultural life of the community. Commencement exercises at the school were events long remembered by the community. Many parents who had come from humble beginnings saw their dreams unfold as they sat in the audience and watched their sons and daughters receive their High School Diplomas.   A building is but bricks and mortar, subject to decay and destruction. A spirit is indestructable so long as it is cherished in the hearts of men and women. So it is with Booker T. Washington High School. The building is gone but the spirit of community service and pride which its students learned within its walls still lives.   Therefore, in recognition of the influence of Booker T. Washington High School in the development and education of the black youth of the city of Columbia and of its significance in the life of the black community of the city. The University of South Carolina has caused this plaque to be erected so that the building which nourished the spirit of all Washingtonians shall be forever remembered. Erected in the City of Columbia in the year of the 200th anniversary of the Independence of the United States, the 175th anniversary of the founding of the University of South Carolina and the anniversary of the opening of Booker T. Washington High School. **********   The original Booker T. Washington High School building was demolished in 1975. Some of the bricks from this historic structure were used in the paving of the university's Horseshoe.",

        "Name": "Bound For Glory-The Railroad Was A Nation Builder",
        "Description_full": "There is no doubt that the railroad defined an American culture and personality that is distinct from its European roots. At its heart, the railroad was a nation builder - the personification of the brash, entrepreneurial spirit that the rest of the world saw in the United States. As early as 1827, William Aiken and Horatio Allen recognized the potential of the railroad to open new markets and to make travel faster and safer. Trains changed American perceptions of time, space, and distance forever and set the stage for later transportation developments like interstate highways and airplanes. The railroads spurred technological growth and innovation. They affected how people and information were distributed across the country. Railways helped settle the middle and western regions of the United States, and were a source of employment for thousands of new immigrants. They were a catalyst for the development of labor unions. The power of the railroad as an icon and symbol of American life is revealed time and again through the works of American authors, poets, playwrights, movie-makers, painters, and songwriters. These artists immortalized trains as glamorous, tragic, romantic, sinister, and patriotic settings for the stories of America. Although trains are no longer a part of the everyday life of most Americans, they still continue to capture our imagination. \"We reached Sans Souci in quick and double quick time... before any of us had time to determine whether or not it was prudent to be scared.\" *Charleston Courier, 1830*",

        "Description_full": "The original Anderson High School sat on the corner of North Fant and East Calhoun Streets. All grade levels were taught despite being called a high school. This school burned down in 1904 and was rebuilt the following year. Due to overcrowding, students of Anderson High School continued to be placed in several different school locations. To alleviate the problem, the school board contracted architect J.M. Baldwin to draw plans for a new school. The school board purchased two lots of land on the corner of Greenville and North McDuffie Streets. The new building was completed in 1918. In September of 1918, Anderson High School opened for the first time at 200 Greenville Street. The high school caught fire in 1921, which consumed the auditorium and ruined the entire south side of the building. In that year, the school board decided there was a need for two high schools, one school for the girls and the other for the boys. The school board's rational for the separation was to allow each school to teach subjects and skills beneficial to each gender. The newly renovated Anderson High School became Girls High School. The new school building was named Anderson Boys High School and located on the corner of South McDuffie and Broyles Street. Opening day was September 3, 1923. Four acres of land behind Boys High School were later purchased for athletic fields. The sports fields were dedicated on November 14, 1924, and the next day, Clemson planted The Citadel on the new fields with Citadel winning 20-0. Boys High School burned down in May of 1925 and was re-built by December 1925. In 1961, the decision was made that students would no longer be separated by gender. By September 1962, the students from both high schools were reunited into one school for the first time since 1923. The students began school for the 1962-63 school year in the school built further out on Greenville Street and was named T.L. Hannah High School. The Boys High School building was used for extracurricular classes. Later it was reopened as a vocational high school and renamed McDuffie High School. Major renovations occurred which changed the appearance of the building so that the only thing left of the original Boys High School today is the left arched entranceway. Boys High Mural sponsored by Boys High and Hannah High (Girls High) Class of 1962.",

        "Description_full": "The first settlement of the town of Branchville was 1735 about one mile southeast of the present town. Almost 100 years later, the present town grew from 170 acres of land purchased from the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company. It was located about halfway between Charleston and Hamburg (North Augusta, South Carolina). (Far left text) America's First Commercial Railroad America began operations on its first railroad on Christmas Day, 1830, when the Best Friend of Charleston speeded along, as some passengers described \"on the wings of the wind at a speed of 20 miles per hour, annihilating both time and space and leaving all the world behind.\" Construction of the railroad began in 1829 just outside of Charleston, South Carolina, and in 1833 it was completed to Hamburg. The distance was 136 miles and at the time was the longest railroad in the world and twice as long as any in the United States. The railroad branched out from Branchville to Orangeburg in 1840 and became the first Railroad junction in the world. (Lower middle text) Changes in Branchville The first mail was carried on the rail line from Charles to Hamburg and the first village delivery of mail was in Branchville. The town was also the first to own their own telephone exchange and electric plant. The rail line was also used to haul troops during the Civil War. The site of the battery remains where Confederate troops burned the bridge and turned Sherman's troops around Branchville through Orangeburg. (Right text) The Depot was built in 1877 and in 1910 the sheds and waiting room were added. The dining room was the first Passenger Dining Room where trains would stop for breakfast and dinner. It claims the distinction of having had three former U.S. Presidents dine there; President William McKinley, President Theodore Roosevelt and President Howard Taft. The Southern Railway Passenger Depot stands today as a symbol of Branchville's rich railroad history and contains Branchville's Railroad Shrine and Museum.",

Here travelers obtained refreshments, meals and lodging while hearing and discussing the latest news. William died in 1815, followed by Martha in 1816.

If the kitchen caught on fire it would not endanger the house. As in homes today, the 19th century kitchen was a hub of activities including cooking, conversing and cleaning. Unlike the indoor kitchens of today, cooking, washing and other chores were performed outside around the kitchen in an area known as the yard. The plantation cooks, all slaves, had a variety of ingredients available to them, many grown or obtained on plantation lands. The meals they prepared for the Brattons and their guests might include meats such as deer, quail, turkey, chicken, mutton, beef; fresh and dried herbs for flavoring; vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, and beans; preserved fruit; breads and wine. The cooks were also responsible for cleaning up after meals, harvesting the kitchen gardens, and preserving and storing foods.",

Colonel Buford refused.Tarleton's ploy delayed the Virginians long enough to allow the British advance guard to catch up with and capture Buford's rear guard, consisting of only five men. Colonel Buford sent his wagons, baggage, and artillery ahead and chose his defensive position: a single defensive line \"in an open wood to the right of the road.\"At a distance of three hundred yards, Tarleton halted and formed a reserve \"upon a small eminence that commanded the road.\"He divided his force into three groups to simultaneously attack Buford's left, , and right; Tarleton led the assault on the left flank.Buford's FollyBuford ordered his line to withhold their fire until the charging cavalrymen were only at ten yards distance. The tactic was a serious mistake. The horsemen immediately overran Buford's line. Tarleton was shot off his horse. Loyalists sabered and bayoneted the Continentals; some tried to surrender, waving white flags, others fought stubbornly, and a few fled. Colonel Buford escaped on horseback.British casualties were minimal &amp;#8211; only five killed and fourteen wounded, while American losses were substantial &amp;#8211; 113 killed, 150 wounded (many of whom later died), and 53 taken prisoner.From map insets:Buford's Command: � 350 Virginia Continentals of the Third Provisional Regiment, � 40 Virginia Light Dragoons, � Two six-pounder guns and crews.

        "Description_full": "Between 1862 and 1885, the United States undertook construction of a railroad to connect the East with the West. The Central Pacific Railroad was built 742 miles eastward from Sacramento. The Union Pacific was built 1,038 miles westward from Omaha. Owners met at Promontory Summit, Utah on May 10, 1869 and hammered home the Golden Spike creating a new transportation network that revolutionized the West and the country. Completion of the transcontinental railroad created a boom in railroad construction across the country. There were 30,000 miles of track in the nation in 1860. This number increased to 201,000 miles by 1900. However the zenith of the American railroad occurred in 1916 when there were 254,000 miles of track across the country. Railroads employed over 2,000,000 people in 1920, and an amazing 98 percent of all intercity passenger traffic was by rail. The 1840s and 1850s were a boom time in Southern railroad construction. Lines were built between Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina. The most ambitious line was completed in 1857 when 760 miles of track connected Charleston with Memphis, Tennessee. This line joined the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. The railways declined after World War I. By 1957, the number of airplane travelers passed the number of train passengers for the first time. \"... the more economical outlets we can open through this chain, the more will the resources of the west develop themselves and the more will the east and the west become united by indissoluble bonds of common interest.\" * William Howard, 1829*",

Thompson, this building was the main street depot for the Anderson Petroleum Company and Dixie Distributors, Inc., both successful petroleum distributors in Anderson, Oconee, Pickens, Greenwood, Abbeville, and McCormick counties. Thompson's companies imported petroleum products from the adjacent P&amp;N rail depot. This building's distinctive \"stone and red mortar\" facade was the architectural signature of Thompson's Dixie Petroleum Stations. Major Frank R. Thompson (1903-1977) Frank R. Thompson's lifelong career in the oil business began in 1915, in the office of Standard Oil of New Jersey, in his hometown of Concord, N.C. He moved his family to Anderson in the 1920s, when he became Standard Oil's North-Western South Carolina Sales Manager. His wife, Mary Francis Swittenberg, was a native Andersonian. In 1930, Thompson resigned from Standard Oil and formed the Anderson Petroleum Company to distribute Shell Petroleum products. In 1937, Thompson severed his connection with Shell and assumed presidency of Dixie Distributors, Inc. -- a position he held until his retirement in 1975. An active business, political and military leader, with a love for all sports, Thompson was described as a \"quiet philanthropist...who never turned down a charitable institution.\" Thompson was a proponent for the construction of Hartwell Dam. He was also benefactor to hundreds of charitable institutions , including the Anderson Kiwanis Club, the American Legion, Crippled Children of S.C., Inc., Veterans of Foreign Wars, Hiriam Masonic Lodge No. 68, Anderson TB Association, the Anderson Flying Club, and the Anderson Chamber of Commerce. In 1945, Thompson also received the Bronze Star Medal for services in Africa and Europe and achieved the rank of Major in the United States Corps of Engineers. Thompson's close friends included President Lyndon B. Johnson, Sen. Strom Thurmond, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Gen. George Patton and boxer Jack Dempsey.",

Each station had a choice of markers from which to shoot; shooting from the marker further away from the target earned more points than shooting from a closer-in position. Archers brought their own bows and arrows, and if they wanted a bull's eye to aim at, they brought a target cloth to place over the bales. On this archery range, the longest distance from which to shoot at a target was some twenty yards. Archery was a popular sport and a local club helped to maintain this course.",

Burke merged with Avery High School in 1954, was accredited, and was renamed Burke High School, in a new complex on this site. It was rebuilt in 2005.",

John Dart at the corner of Bogard and Krake Streets, Charleston Normal and Industrial School was approved to become a public school for \"colored\" children in 1910 and opened at the 244 President Street site on January 3, 1911. In 1921, the school was renamed J.E. Burke Industrial School and by 1929, Burke was serving fifth through eleventh graders. In 1954, Burke and Avery merged as Burke High School and became accredited by the Southern Association of College and Secondary Schools; becoming one of the first high schools for African Americans to be accredited in the state. Serving as the \"Mother Ship\" of all the City of Charleston high schools, Burke graciously received students of Avery, C.A. Brown, Rivers, the High School of Charleston, and Immaculate Conception School, as each closed, leaving Burke High as the only high school on the peninsula. Over the past four generations, Burke High School has graduated thousands of African American students with academic and trade preparation to stand equal and surpass many of the \"privileged\" children at state and national universities, including Ivy League colleges. Burke also produced many successful entrepreneurs,educators, doctors, lawyers, religious leaders, military leaders, politicians, tradesmen and other contributing members of our society. Burke High produced some of the best teachers and administrators who not only taught the academic content requirements, but who took the time to teach students responsibility, manners, accountability, self-control, good behavior; respect for country, self and others. They invested in the whole child. We, stand tall with the support of our parents, administration, faculty, staff, alumni classes, sister schools, and the Burke High School Foundation in celebrating this 100th year milestone of being an academic institution for African American students.

By early 1849 approximately 30-40 \"persons of color\" attended in the morning, 100 in the afternoon and 276 in the Sunday school. As laws prohibited teaching a slave to read, all instructions in the church and Sunday school were oral. The original church was a brick structure covered with stucco and painted white with a combination of straight and curved lines. The building was completed and consecrated on December 23, 1849 by the Right Reverend Christopher E. Gadsden. A two- story annex was built at the south of the church in 1924 and housed the kindergarten. Services ended at the old building on November 25, 1940, and the church was deconsecrated. The property was sold and monies from the sale were used to build the present building at Line and Percy Streets. Cavalry Episcopal was recognized as a mission in the Convention of the Diocese of SC on May 5, 1965. Father Stephen Macky, the vicar became the first rector.

        "Description_full": "At the start of the American Revolution, Camden was located here, just south of the present city. It was home to at least thirty families, a Presbyterian church, and a Quaker meetinghouse. With its court house, stores, artisans, and grist mills to grind the wheat produced by local farmers, Camden was the political and economic of the surrounding region. Joseph Kershaw and others made their fortunes doing business in the town. Camden�s importance increased during the Revolution because of its location along the Great Wagon Road. Troops and supplies moving overland had to travel through Camden or take a longer route west of the town. Roads to Cheraw, Augusta, Georgia, and Cross Creek, North Carolina, also passed through Camden. After the British occupied South Carolina, Camden became their main supply base in the southern backcountry, as well as the starting point for their intended invasion of North Carolina. The farms in and around Camden fed the British garrison. Camden was also a vital link through which supplies and reinforcements from Charleston were shipped to the Loyalists who lived farther west along the Broad and Saluda rivers and around Ninety Six and to the British units supporting them. Camden was equally important to the Americans. If they could retake the town, North Carolina would be secure from invasion and the Loyalists in western South Carolina would be cut off from British support. The British would no longer have the chance to subjugate the other southern states and would be forced to withdraw to the coast. These factors made Camden the strategic key for both sides in the Southern Campaign. In addition to being the scene of two major Revolutionary War battles, Camden was at the of the bloody fighting that raged through the South from 1778 to 1781. The town�s strategic importance was demonstrated when the British were forced to evacuate Camden in May 1781 following the Battle of Hobkirk�s Hill. General Nathanael Greene was then able to drive the British and Loyalists from the backcountry of South Carolina and Georgia. These successes ultimately led to the British evacuations of Savannah (July 1782) and Charleston (December 1782). &amp;#8220;The whole interior Country had revolted.&amp;#8221; Lord Rawdon to Colonel Balfour, British Commandant of Charleston, following Rawdon�s evacuation of Camden",

The two towers that flank this entrance and the two former warehouses along the walkway are associated with Camden Depot, built in the 1850s. The former depot is part of the William Aiken House and Associated Railroad Structures National Historic Landmark. The landmark includes some of the best extant antebellum buildings associated with early railroad development in the South. The most distinct features of Camden Depot are the tiered crenelated towers that front Ann Street. The crenelations or battlements create the look of a medieval fort or castle. The towers are made of stone and are typical of the Gothic Revival style. Gothic Revival is an architectural term that refers to the revival of building styles from the Middle Ages in Europe. It was popular in the United States from the 1830s until the 20th century, particularly for churches and educational buildings. It is this style that makes Camden Depot unique. Gothic Revival was an uncommon architectural design for railroad buildings. The railroad ran down the of this courtyard. If you look closely at the bricks, you can see they are laid in a pattern to recreate the tracks. On either side of the tracks are two former warehouses. The original buildings constructed in 1850 were wooden. The current brick and metal buildings were built in 1910. The warehouses were used for storing and moving goods. More information about Camden Depot and the South Carolina Canal 7 Rail Road Company is presented at several locations along the courtyard. An alternative version of the text is available at the Visitors Center. &amp;#8220;An intelligent, prosperous, and enterprising people are never long in embracing any system, which will be highly beneficial to their interests.&amp;#8221; Ellias Horry, 1833.

        "Name": "Campbell's Covered Bridge",
        "Description_full": "Many generations of area residents have treasured Campbell's Covered Bridge as a local icon and place to enjoy Beaverdam Creek on a hot day, meet neighbors while your corn is ground, or as a quiet place to court your sweetheart. There are many stories of family picnics, engagement proposals and photographs of friends at Campbell's Covered Bridge. It was a place to weather a sudden storm or pull the motor out a pickup truck. Stella M. Atkins felt strongly that the cherished bridge needed to be preserved for the future, so in 1975 she bought the bridge, the old Smith house, the grist mill and surrounding acreage adding to it the land the Atkins family bought in 1968. In 1933, at the age of 12, Stella went with the Campbell girls to water their mules at the bridge. Stella's mount bent down to drink and slid Stella off its neck into the creek and mud. The Campbell girls washed her dress, so she wouldn't get in trouble at home. In 1922 her grandson William Travis Pittman transformed the house and garden by creating the majority of stone masonry that still exist. He added many geological surprises by embedding them into the steps, walls and patio spaces. Unfortunately in 2001 the house and Travis' antique collection perished in a fire. But the bridge continued to be an attraction even when the road was relocated and the bridge was cut off from vehicle traffic. In 1991, Stella gave part of the property to her daughter, Sylvia A. Pittman, with instructions to save Campbell's Covered Bridge for the future. Sylvia did as her mother wanted by working with Greenville County and interested historic groups to keep the bridge in good shape and allowing many visitors. Sylvia, like her mother also has a spill in the creek at twelve and a long term appreciation for Campbell's Covered Bridge. Sylvia started with the gift of 1.47 acres, then purchased another 1.47 acres from her sister, Genell Duncan and other adjoining acreage for a total of almost 15 acres. Sylvia A. Pittman sold the bridge and acreage in 2008 to the Greenville County Recreation District with instructions for it to be developed as an official public historic site and be preserved for future generations.",

        "Description_full": "In the earliest of times the rock shoal upstream of the bridge was used as a ford until a flat bridge was built across Beaverdam Creek. In Monday, August 24, 1908 starting at 7:00 p.m., twenty inches of rain fell during the next twenty-four hours. This freshet washed out the bridge and local residents again used the ford to cross. Charles Irwin Willis (1878-1966) built the current 35 feet long by 12 feet wide bridge on land owned by Alexander Lafayette Campbell (1836-1920). Willis let the truss ends follow the natural lay of the land and then built the rest of the bridge to fit; therefore, the bridge is not square or plumb. The bridge has a four Howe truss on each side (criss-crossing braces with vertical tie rods called Kingposts). William Howe from Spencer, Massachusetts, patented his new truss design in 1840 and it was commonly used for railroad bridges. The truss absorbs and transfers a passing vehicle's weight to the rock abutments on each end of the bridge. The bridge was restored in 1964 with the cooperation of the Crescent Community Club and again in 1990 by Greenville County. In 1951 Pleasant Hill Road was rerouted around the bridge and in 1984 Campbell's Covered Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic. Downstream from the bridge Mr. Campbell operated a corn grist mill. In 1938 Joseph Daniel Smith built a new corn grist mill at the same site. He built a dam on the rock shoal about 75 feet upstream of the bridge, drilling into the rock to stabilize the dam structure. The dam created a mill pond and water was carried from the pond to the mill in a face fashioned from 30 gallon steel barrels that passed through the bridge abutment. Originally, the mill was powered by an overshot waterwheel and later by a side shot turbine wheel with a vertical shaft. The mill was closed in the 1950s. The foundations of the mill and the Smith House (1938) are visible downstream of the bridge. In 1979 E.O. Productions filmed a scene here for the movie, A Day of Judgement. The film was set in the early 1900s and included a scene of an avenging angel riding a horse out of the bridge to take justice. The bridge is often photographed and featured in Upstate South Carolina Tourism guides.",

What is now the Cannon Street Y was organized under the leadership of Harry W. Thomas in 1866. It was established using the name Charleston Negro YMCA to serve the needs of former slaves, freed by adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. Of three Black YMCAs organized during that period, only Cannon Street Y continues to operate independently; i.e. not being taken over by a city or some other agency. This YMCA originally operated its programs from area churches, businesses, meeting halls, offices and private homes of its members. This arrangement continued until 1950 when the present facility was built at 61 Cannon Street. The dedication plaque above the historical marker reads: &amp;#8220;All I am interested in is the privilege of giving the Negro boys of Charleston the same privilege all boys of the world are allowed under the laws of Little League Inc Williamsport, Pa.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Robert F.

He risked his life as he had to fly at a mere 500 feet in order to pinpoint the survivor's location. When an enemy truck appeared to be heading toward his survivor, Captain Johnson directed his flight to destroy it, thus securing the rescue. It was his superior airmanship and his masterly techniques of orchestration that made this rescue happen, the first in the history of the A-10 weapons system. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, Captain Johnson reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force. For his heroic actions, Captain Johnson was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1991 at a base ceremony.",

        "Description_full": "Less than a mile from this point, close to the Georgia shoreline of Lake Thurmond, lays the remains of Fort Charlotte now 50 feet under water. Named after the wife of King George III, Fort Charlotte was a British fort built in 1766. It was located on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River about one and one-half miles below the mount of the Broad River and the settlement of Vienna, where the river was shallow and about 660 feet wide. Originally garrisoned by British troops, the fort was abandoned in 1768 and turned over to the Colonial administration. Discussion ensured as to dismantle the fort or convert it for other public use. Another, fort, however, (Fort Prince George) was found to be unsafe and ordered to be abandoned with its ordinance stores, arms and ammunition sent to Fort Charlotte. This greatly increased the importance of Fort Charlotte, which was commanded by Capt. George Whitefield with 15 troops under his command. Consequently, the Council of Safety created by the Provincial Congress on June 1, ordered Major James Mayson to lead a Patriot force of two companies of Rangers, dispatched from Ninety Six, consisting of 53 men (Capt. John Caldwell and his company of 28 men, and Capt. Moses Kirkland and his company of 23 men) to seize the munitions at Fort Charlotte. Upon his arrival on July 12, 1775, the fort and all its possessions were peacefully surrendered to him by Capt. Whitefield, and subsequently placed under the command of Capt. John Caldwell and a company of 15 men. The seizure of Charlotte was the first overt act of the American Revolution in South Carolina. Third South Carolina Regiment (Rangers) 1775-1780 The regiment was established by the South Carolina Provincial Congress in June 1775, as mounted riflemen who used horses for transportation but dismounted to fight on foot. It consisted of a lieutenant colonel commandant, a major, 9 captains, 18 lieutenants, a surgeon, paymaster, an adjutant and a quartermaster, and with each of its 9 companies having 2 sergeants, a drummer, and 50 privates. The regiment was placed on the Continental Establishment in September 1776 as mounted riflemen, and in October its complement increased to 600 men in 12 companies, with the commanding officer, the major, and the senior captain all being promoted one grade. The regiment was recruited in the backcountry and on the frontiers, and normally served in multi-company detachments, one of which took over Fort Charlotte in July 1775. Another detachment was bloodied in the fighting at Ninety Six in November 1775 and in the \"Snow Campaign\" that followed. In June 1776 the whole regiment defended the eastern end of Sullivan's Island when the British attempted an amphibious assault during the naval attack on the fort, which was later named Fort Moultrie.",

The deep lot also holds several of the original structures, including a kitchen house, carriage house, servants� quarters and stables. The house is noted for its Adam style interior with elaborate decorative plaster molding, and is distinguished by an elegant curved elliptical stair that ascends to the third floor. In 1821 the property was purchased by John Fraser, a partner in the cotton export firm of Fraser, Trenholm and Company. During the Civil War the company ran a fleet of blockade runners that brought in supplies to aid the Confederate war effort. Charles T. Lowndes, a wealthy merchant, purchased the property in 1836 and it remained in the Lowndes family until 1930. His son, Rawlins Lowndes, a rice planter and Confederate captain, inherited the house in 1886. His wife, Sarah Buchanan Preston, affectionately known as &amp;#8220;Buck,&amp;#8221; was the niece of famed Wade Hampton, a Confederate general and later South Carolina Governor. She was also a prominent subject of Mary Boykin Chestnut�s popular Confederate memoir, A Diary from Dixie. During the Lowndes family ownership, the property was enhanced and enlarged from its original design. The adjacent lot was purchased and the building on it demolished in order to create a formal garden. In addition, the existing three tiered piazzas were constructed, distinguished by graduating orders of Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns and turned balusters.",

In 1764, the province of South Carolina allotted them 15 miles square in York and Lancaster Districts. About 1840 a new treaty was made, the state buying all their land, and afterwards laying them off 700 acres on the west bank of the Eswa Tavora (Catawba River) 6 miles south of Fort Mill.

Permanent church structures were few and far between and camp meetings served both religious and social purposes.

In 1934 the Methodist conference decided to discontinue operation of Center Methodist and transferred all church membership to Townville Methodist. However records indicate that members continued to meet for services for several years afterwards. In late 2009 the United Methodist Conference of South Carolina gave Center Methodist Church and property to the Oconee Heritage Center in order to preserve and interpret Oconee's abundant religious history.

        "Description_full": "Charles Pinckney National Historic Site honors Charles Pinckney honors Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, one of the drafters and signers of the Constitution of the United States. Charles Pinckney (1757-1824) was one of the members of the Articles of Confederation Congress who actively worked for the calling of a convention to draft a constitution for the new United States. He was one of South Carolina�s four delegates to the 1787 Constitution in Philadelphia. Pinckney played an active role in the Constitutional Convention and in the ratification process that followed. For the remainder of his life he was involved in politics at the state and national level as an ally and supporter of Thomas Jefferson. In 1776, the signers of the Declaration of Independence had pledged &amp;#8220;their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor&amp;#8221; to the cause for American independence. Charles Pinckney followed their precepts. Because of his public service, Pinckney neglected his personal affairs and lost his fortune - including Snee Farm. The acquisition and preservation of Snee Farm is a remarkable story of cooperation between private citizens and the federal government. In 1987, a group of South Carolinians formed an organization called The Friends of Historic Snee Farm. The group�s sole purpose was to raise the funds necessary to purchase this 28-acre site as a lasting tribute to Charles Pinckney. By July 1988 The Friends had raised more that two million dollars, bought the property, and turned it over to the National Park Service for preservation and interpretation. Although this property belonged to the Pinckney family for more than a half-century (1754-1817), this house was not Charles Pinckney�s home. His Snee Farm house disappeared sometime early in the first quarter of the 19th century. This building is a classic example of a 19th century lowcountry plantation house and architecturally significant in its own right. The Charles Pinckney National Historic Site is an interpretation of the life and times of Charles Pinckney and of the contributions made to American history and culture by the diverse population of the South Carolina lowcountry.

        "Description_full": "British and American forces struggled for control of this strategic city throughout America�s quest for independence. The Revolution in South Carolina began in 1775 when Patriot leaders overthrew the British colonial government in Charles Town. The following year, a large British force attacked to regain control of the seaport, rally Loyalist support, and eventually restore British rule. On June 28, 1776, Patriots here on Sullivan�s Island repelled the attacks to win one of America�s first great victories of the war.Charles Town was relatively calm for the next three years while the British concentrated their war effort in the Northern states. After General Washington�s army fought the British to a stalemate in the North, South Carolina became the main battleground of the American Revolution. British troops threatened Charles Town again in 1779, before Generals Clinton and Cornwallis captured the city with an overwhelming force in 1780. The surrender of Charles Town and nearly 6,000 soldiers was the American�s greatest single loss of manpower during the war.While patriots in Charles Town suffered under British military occupation, the British army and Loyalists under Lord Cornwallis fought their way through the Carolinas in hundreds of battles, skirmishes, and guerilla actions. Men, women, and children on both sides endured terrible hardships and brutality. After a year of relentless resistance, Cornwallis moved into Virginia and was defeated at Yorktown.Meanwhile, American troops led by General Nathanael Greene gradually drove British forces remaining in South Carolina back to their last refuge in the occupied city of Charles Town. The long and grueling struggle ended in December 1782 when the British evacuated, sailing past Sullivan�s Island and leaving the Americans in control. With the successful conclusion of the war in 1783, the new nation was free to pursue its revolutionary ideals. &amp;#8220; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&amp;#8221; .United States Declaration of IndependenceAdopted July 4th, 1776Six days after the American victoryon Sullivan�s Island( Sidebar : )Beautiful sophisticated Charles Town was one of the largest and wealthiest cities in British North America.

        "Name": "Charleston City Market",
        "Description_full": "On this site stands one of Charleston�s oldest public facilities in continuous use: the Charleston Market. Earlier markets, dating back to the city�s relocation to the peninsula, ca. 1680, offered meat, fish, and vegetables at different sites. After the American Revolution, however, the city sought to consolidate this activity in one location and chose the present site, which was then a creek and marsh extending from Meeting Street to the Cooper River, briefly designated Canal or Channel Street.---------------Six neighbors, among them Charles Cotesworth Pickney, who owned the largest portion, donated land in March 1788, directing the city to open a market. By 1792, some marsh and creek had been filled and a 200 foot long brick market, stood near Meeting Street. In late 1793, the city converted that structure to house refugees from Santo Domingo, and the land reverted to its original owners because a market had not been erected within the specified time. Once the property was again donated to the city in 1804 and construction resumed. The &amp;#8220;Centre Market&amp;#8221;, consisting of separate sheds for fresh meats and vegetables, opened 1 August 1807, while sheds for fish and &amp;#8220;small meats&amp;#8221; opened later. Here, the city�s population, both slave and free, gathered daily to sell and buy locally raised commodities and imported delicacies.---------------Market Hall, designed by E.B. White and built for the Meetings of the Market Commissioners and others, opened in 1841 on the site of the original depot for country wagons. The rise of grocery stores and refrigeration in the early twentieth century sapped the market�s vitality, and its fortunes steadily declined. Renewal projects beginning in the 1970�s spurred a revitalization of the market and surrounding area. The historic restoration of Market Hall was completed by the City of Charleston in 2003. In 2010, the market sheds were completely restored by the City of Charleston, in partnership with the City Marker Preservation Trust.---------------The Market was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. Although damaged by fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and an earthquake, the City Market continues to function in the heart of the Historic District as one of Charleston�s most cherished institutions.This plaque was placed in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the City Market.",

        "Name": "Charleston Harbor",
        "Description_full": "Seventeenth Century Charles Town, named for Charles II, was settled in 1670, a few miles north of this site, on the west bank of the Ashley River It was the capital of the Colony of the Carolinas. In 1671, the Lords Proprietors ordered a fort nearer the sea be laid out on Oyster Point at the juncture of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, where there was a &amp;#8220;bold landing&amp;#8221; for ships. Charles Town moved to its present site in 1680 as one of America�s first planned cities. The &amp;#8220;Grand Modell&amp;#8221; ed on a square with a street along the Cooper River known as &amp;#8220;The Bay&amp;#8221;. Now East Bay, it lies to the west of this location and is still a principal commercial thoroughfare. The city was ed on the area around the Old Exchange building westward of this park. Exports of lumber, naval stores, salted meats and deer skins were the basis of the city�s first fortunes. Home to a diverse citizenry, early Charles Town took pride in her religious freedom and vigorous maritime trade. [Panel 2:]Eighteenth Century Charles Town was a walled city from about 1704 to about 1720. The walls protected the city from hostile attacks by the Spaniards, French, Indians and pirates. In 1719, South Carolina overthrew the Lords Proprietors and became a Royal Colony. Charles Town grew rich from exports of rice and indigo and became a cultural with close ties to England. When colonial rights were threatened, she was a leader in forming a new nation. Her fine harbor made her the South�s major port and largest city. It also attracted British invaders. The Royal Navy attacked the forts at the harbor entrance to the east. The attack was repelled, but the city was captured and occupied by British armies coming from the south. Four Charlestonians signed the Declaration of Independence: John Rutledge and Charles Pinckney contributed importantly to the writing of the United States Constitution. [Panel 3:]Nineteenth Century Charleston, so spelled after 1745, was quick to recover from the Revolution and military occupation. Rice, Sea Island cotton and trade provided the highest per capita wealth of any American city in 1860. Grand houses, public buildings, and plantations were built. Her advocacy of states� rights, nullification and secession gave her national importance. The Civil War began in 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter, three miles southeastward of this point. During four years of struggle, the waterfront was the scene of naval activities involving armored warships, torpedo boats, a submarine and blockade runners. This area was under heavy shellfire from the Barrier Islands. Besieged, bombarded, and impoverished by the War, Charleston lost her economic and political stature. Banks, railroads, phosphate mining and agricultural exports revived trade by the 1880s. A major earthquake in 1886 devastated the city but failed to kill her spirit. [Panel 4:]Twentieth Century In the early part of the 20th century, Charleston continued her slow recovery from war, military occupation and social upheaval. In 1900, a naval base was established on the Cooper River, four miles upstream. In 1902, the West Indian Exposition, on the site of Hampton Park on the north side of town drew international attention, and the Cooper River Bridge opened in 1929. Growth of the military presence in both World Wars buttressed the economy. The nations� preservation movement began in Charleston where the first historic district zoning ordinance was adopted in 1931. The rebuilding of the port wall, begun after 1945, restored the harbor to its former maritime importance. On this spot, stood Mallory Line�s ship terminals, once the city�s busiest, were destroyed by a spectacular fire in 1955. Since the late 1970s, racial harmony, economic revitalization, a cultural renaissance, and attention to urban design have brought Charlestonians a new measure of prosperity and pride in their city. A fierce hurricane, steering straight for this park, as yet incomplete, fell upon the city and harbor in September 1989. It created new challenges, but as the 20th century drew to a close, Charleston was looking to the future with her usual confidence and vision.

The 32 buildings and structures that comprise the district represent two periods of development at the Naval Base that closely relate to the growth of the Navy during the 20th century. A prior hospital, constructed in 1917, was demolished in 1922 as demand for hospital services declined after World War I. Only two Craftsman-style residential cottages built in 1917 survive from that period (Quarters 1 and 2), while the remainder of the structures were built just prior to and during World War II, including the existing hospital complex. Three groups of buildings comprise the historic district: treatment facilities ed on the main hospital complex; service related buildings located to the east of the main hospital building; and residential buildings for officers and staff that are located to the west and south of the hospital. Spanish Colonial style influences such as smooth white walls, hipped roofs with overhanging eaves, and red terra cotta roof tiles are prevalent throughout the district. The Naval Hospital continued to serve sailors, those who worked at the base and their families until 1972, when a new high-rise hospital was built on nearby Rivers Avenue.

Chicora Park, named for the local Chicora Indians, featured leisurely winding roads with paths and bridges over the marsh areas and extensive landscaping. The design followed English landscape tradition with no fences or defined boundaries. Amenities included a bandstand, a golf course, and a wharf on the Cooper River. Charlestonians took a trolley directly from downtown to the park on weekends. When the Navy purchased the property from the City in 1901, much of the landscaping plan was retained and Olmsted's system of winding roads was adopted. The Officers' Quarters Historic District consists of 28 structures and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.Source: National Register of Historic Places nomination form: Charleston Naval Yard Officers' Quarters Historic District (listed in 2007)",

Construction of the Navy Yard began in 1901 as a response to the emergence of the United States as a world power.

As it expanded, the Charleston Navy Yard became one of the most significant American naval installations in the first half of the twentieth century. The district contains industrial buildings, administrative buildings, support structures and storage facilities. Buildings in the district reflected national naval construction design trends ranging from 1900 to 1945: (1) Neo-Classical style (circa 1903 to 1910; (2) Moderne industrial form (1910s to the end of World War I); (3) the construction of federal works projects (between the World Wars); and (4) the mostly utilitarian form prevalent from the emergency period (late 1930s through the end of World War II).

The British did not repeat their earlier mistakes.A British fleet of 96 ships arrived off Charleston on February 17, 1780. General Henry Clinton, with an army of 8,500, landed 30 miles south of Charleston. Clinton moved north to capture Fort Johnson, then marched on the city.Vice Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot, commander of the British fleet, chose to bypass Fort Moultrie rather than attack it. The fleet stayed 800 yards offshore and quickly sailed past, despite Moultrie�s guns, and anchored in Charleston Harbor. Fort Moultrie was powerless to protect the city, and the siege of Charleston began.During the siege, most of Fort Moultrie�s garrison moved to defend Charleston, leaving the fort with only 160 men, who surrendered to the British on May 7, 1780. Completely cut off by land and sea, Charleston surrendered on May 12. The port then served the British until 1782. The loss of Charleston was a crushing blow to the patriots.",

The local community, Gowensville, is named for John \"Buck\" Gowen, a Revolutionary War soldier for whom the nearby Gowen's Fort was named. A skirmish at the fort on July 13, 1780, was the first in a series of eight confrontations leading to the tide-turning battle of the Cowpens in in January, 1781. Foothills and mountainous regions from this location to the west for generations have been referred to as the \"Dark Corner.\" In the early 19th Century, the name was used because of the strong Unionist leanings of the residents of this area during South Carolina's Nullification Crisis, then in the late 19th Century the connotation of the name changed because of the \"white lightning\" whiskey making in the area and its associated lawlessness. Nearby historic sites are First Baptist Church (1820) and Earlesdale (1871), sites for Gowensville Seminary (1858-90), Gowensville School (1922), and Campbell's Covered Bridge (1909), the sole-surviving original covered bridge in South Carolina.

Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt) is the ninth, and highest, enlisted rank in the United States Air Force, just above Senior Master Sergeant, and is a non-commissioned officer. The official term of address is Chief Master Sergeant or Chief.Attaining the rank of Chief Master Sergeant is the pinnacle of an Air Force enlisted member's career. Some Chief Master Sergeants manage the efforts of all enlisted personnel within their unit or major subsection thereof, while others run major staff functions at higher headquarters levels. All Chief Master Sergeants are expected to serve as mentors for company-grade and field-grade commissioned officers, as well as noncommissioned officers and junior enlisted members, and to serve as advisors to unit commanders and senior officers. By Federal law, only one percent of the Air Force enlisted force may hold this rank. Chief Master Sergeant Cope retired as Chief Master Sergeant around 1973.

Moser 1992   Chief Master Sergeant Ronald L. Satterwhite The Senior Listed Advisor position was created and established in 1974 to aid commanders in addressing issues having an impact on the airmen and non-commissioned officers within the various echelons of command throughout the United States Air Force. In the case of Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, the senior enlisted advisor was selected by the wing commander from the ranks of the most senior non-commissioned officers. It was a prestigious position and the non-commissioned officer in that position was in effect, a representative of the entire enlisted force at that base. The senior enlisted advisor was attuned to the morale and welfare of the force and advised the wing commander on policies and programs that aided in improving morale and living conditions of airmen and that promoted good order and discipline. In that regard the senior enlisted advisor was a key member of the wing commander's staff. This sign honors the senior enlisted advisors who served at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base from the inception of the program until base closure. ( adjacent marker ) Mr. Fred Nash Mr. Fred Nash, at age 71, distinguished himself by heroism involving voluntary risk of life on August 18, 1958 at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. On that date, Mr. Nash observed an Air Force T-33 aircraft crash land and burst into flames at the Myrtle Beach State Park pier near \"Nash's Grill.&amp;#8221; Despite the possibility of exploding fuel cells and without the benefit of protective clothing or extinguishing agents, Mr. Nash rushed to the side of the burning aircraft to render assistance. Although he sustained serious burns, Mr. Nash persevered in his efforts until he succeeded in leading an injured Air Force officer to a place of safety where he extinguished the flames on the victim's body. The exemplary courage displayed by Mr. Nash on this occasion earned for him the sincere gratitude of the United States Air Force. Mr. Nash received the United States Air Force Exceptional Service Award in Recognition of Distinguished Patriotic Service in April 1959. Mr. Fred Nash (left) receives Exceptional Service Award from Maj Gen David W. Hutchinson, Commander of the Ninth Air Force at Shaw Air Force Base, during a dinner meeting of the Base Community Council at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Officers Club.",

He graduated from Winyah High School in Georgetown, South Carolina, and enlisted in the United States Air Force shortly thereafter. After completing basic training he entered the Jet Aircraft Mechanics School at Amarillo Air Force Base, Texas and graduated in December 1954. He continued in the aircraft maintenance career field throughout the rest of his tenure in the United States Air Force. His first operational assignment took him to Europe where he served at Chaumont and Laon Air Bases in France, and at Bitburg Air Base, Germany. He was heavily involved in aircraft maintenance in support of the Vietnam War. In 1964 he was deployed to Korat Air Base, Thailand with the first F-105D aircraft in that theater. Again, in 1972 he deployed to Korat Air Base with A-7D aircraft of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing then based at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. He also had two additional tours in Udorn Air Base, Thailand all of which were in direct support of the Vietnam War. He was assigned to the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in September 1970, serving first as NCO-In-Charge of Aircraft Quality Control, and later as Aircraft Maintenance Superintendent in the organizational and flight line maintenance squadrons. As a proven outstanding leader and manager, he was selected to be the Aircraft Maintenance Superintendent of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing and performed at that capacity, achieving superior results in the highly complex and demanding field of combat aircraft maintenance.

Family Services provided services for families stationed at the base, to families living in the area whose sponsor had been reassigned, and to families of people who had been placed on extended temporary duty. Committees of Family Services volunteers carried out functions such as informing all military personnel and their family members of the services provided; relieving emergencies and hardships for family members, particularly in the absence of military sponsors; ensuring that all services of the base, community and voluntary organizations were made available to family members; and training people who volunteered to participate in the program.The Air Force Aid Society rendered assistance to Air Force members and their families or widows through emergency loans and educational scholarships. Services also included non-interest bearing loans, grants and educational benefits. Assistance also was provided that was not within the policies of the American Red Cross.",

The grant to the John Perry family is the land on which Georgetown was founded by Elisha Screven in 1729. Screven never had clear title, so settlement was made in 1737 that returned unsold lots to Mary Perry Cleland and her husband, John. In 1785, forty-nine citizens asked the state legislature for authority to elect three commissioners, which was granted. Georgetown was incorporated December 19, 1805 and John Keith was elected intendant. In 1892 William Doyle Morgan was elected intendant, then first mayor when the local government reorganized. He served until 1906 and was the major force in planning the centennial celebration. The generous support of local civic groups and participating towns made it quite a celebration. About 1,000 witnessed the day's activities. The day began when a parade marched through town to the ball park and greeted Governor D.C. Heyward. Speaker of the SC House of Representatives, Mendel L. Smith, gave the principal oration. At 4 PM a boat parade, including two U.S. Navy vessels, was viewed. At Prince and Cleland Streets, a fireworks display closed the eventful day. The last set piece ignited, producing the message \"Come Again in 2005\".",

Confederates used a wide variety of weapons at Fort Moultrie. If you look into the cannon barrels here you can see some smoothbores and some that are rifled.Banding cannon increased its firepower. A band of wrought iron expanded by heat, was slipped over the cast iron barrel. The band cooled, shrinking tightly in place, strengthening the breech to withstand the pressure of a greater powder charge. For more strength, additional bands were added.Rifling (cutting spiral grooves in a weapon's bore) gave a stabilizing spin to a projectile. Rifled cannon had greater range than smoothbores of similar size, and their new projectiles were usually more accurate and destructive than the old round shot and shells.The new elongated shells had an aerodynamic shape, and were larger, heavier, and could be filled with explosives.LanyardTo fire mortars and cannon, the hook of the lanyard was attached to the friction primer. When the lanyard cord was pulled, the primer's flame ignited the powder charge. The short-barreled mortar fired spherical shells with timed fuses. Mortars were designated to fire upward in an arc, while cannon fired in a low trajectory.",

        "Description_full": "The diesel-powered submarine Clamagore was commissioned at New London, Conn., in June 1945. Her 30 years of service were spent operating out of Charleston, Key West, and New London. Displacement is over 1,800 tons, length 325 1/2 feet and she can reach a speed of 20 knots on the surface with 10 to 17 submerged. The Clamagore was decommissioned in 1975 and towed to Patriots Point in 1981.While you may have noticed that the submarine's sides are somewhat unsightly due to excessive marine growth, it must be understood she is sitting in a shallow water berth and is actually fully waterborne only about one hour before and after high tide. Since she sits on the bottom the majority of the time, the tide rises and falls up and down her hull resulting in a phenomenon, much like on Yorktown, where marine growth and corrosion are more prevalent and more visible in those areas of her sides where she is alternately exposed to both air and salt water. It would be prohibitively expensive and potentially damaging to the thinner external skin encasing her trim tanks to frequently scrape and clean the barnacles and oysters from her sides. Anti-fouling paint applications are ineffective unless the surface is permanently submerged. Also, the ground on which she sits is not perfectly flat, resulting in her tendency to rest with a starboard list except at those times when she is fully waterborne. With her delicate trim and ballast systems, she often has a list until corrective action is taken, even when fully waterborne.",

(East face) Hope, like the eastern sun, rose bright in the heart of the southerner for home government and the Confed- erate States of America. Overwhelming in numbers and with resources inexhaustable, he fought with patriotism undaunted, and love of country unexcelled in history. Unawed by fear of defeat, he defended the sacredness of home and the sovereignty of his state. (South face) Not to disrupt a righteous union or a true true republic did the Confederate soldier take up arms, but to defend cherished principles of civil rights did he leave his all to do battle unto death. Though overpowered by force he was unbroken in spirit; Offering life as a crowning sacrifice he faced the fate of war; Unconquered in defeat; Undismayed in divine faith, undiscouraged in hope for the future; Untiring in rebuilding. (West face) In 1914 when this memorial is erected to the Confederate soldiers; When the sun of life of the few who remain hovers in the western horizon; As we view their patriotism through half a century past; Of the time stage of their deeds recedes, their lustre brightens. Generations unborn will proudly claim their ancestry. Many answered the last roll call in battle: Others have answered since; The remaining few must soon answer. Their memory lives! Peace! Reverence! Union!",

In 1706 he led a small fleet of local ships that repulsed a combined French and Spanish invasion of the city. Rhett is perhaps best remembered for his capture of the pirate Stede Bonnet in 1718. Considered one of the oldest houses in Charleston, this two story stuccoed brick residence was originally squarish in plan, a layout typical of early Charleston houses. An addition on the northwest side as well as the east and west piazzas, by which the house is now entered from Hasell Street, were added in the early 19th century. When constructed, the house was located outside the city limits on a portion of land known as the Point Plantation. After Rhett acquired the property in 1707 he renamed the twenty eight acres surrounding the house \"Rhettsbury\", a name that was still in use when the area was later subdivided for his granddaughters, Susannah Hasell Quince and Mary Hasell Ancrum. In 1807 the property was purchased by Christopher Fitzsimmons, a wealthy wharf owner. His grandson, Wade Hampton, III (1818-1902), Confederate Lieutenant General, Governor of South Carolina (1876-1879), and United States Senator (1879-1891) was born in this house in 1818.",

        "Description_full": "After Eutaw Springs, the British retreated to their post at Fair Lawn Plantation. In November 1781, Brig. Gen. Francis Marion sent Col. Hezekiah Maham with 180 horsemen and Col. Isaac Shelby with 200 mountain riflemen to eliminate British foraging parties in the area. When the Whigs moved against the hospital and armory at Colleton House, the outnumbered garrison at nearby Fort Fairlawn did not interfere. Maham and Shelby�s forces captured about 150 British soldiers, officers, and doctors without a fight. Those that were well enough to travel were taken as prisoners of war, and the rest were sent to the fort. Then the house ~ containing a substantial store of guns and supplies ~ was destroyed by fire.This incident resulted in much controversy about the proper rules of warfare. The British held Maham and Shelby ~ and their commanding officer, Francis Marion ~ responsible for &amp;#8220;such unmanly practices&amp;#8221; as attacking a &amp;#8220;parcel of sick, helpless soldiers in a hospital at Colleton House&amp;#8221; and burning the building. Gen. Nathaniel Greene, the senior Continental officer in South Carolina, responded that the military supplies stored in the house had made it a legitimate target. Shelby wrote that it was in fact the British, not he and Maham, who had torched Colleton House, while Louisa Carolina Colleton, the owner of the property, accused the British of burning all of the plantation buildings ~ not only the mansion, but barns, granaries, mills, and the entire slave village.",

The nurses sat on the walls surrounding two sides of the property and exchanged household and community news while the children played.

The flight required multiple day/night aerial refuelings and encountered adverse weather conditions. Captain Branch led the only four aircraft in the squadron to complete the mission setting a world time-distance record for an operational flight under nonsimulated conditions. Captain Branch later became the Operations Officer for the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron and deployed with the squadron in support of the Berlin and Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as other major deployments during the Cold War era. After assignments to Headquarters, 12th Air Force, and Headquarters Tactical Air Command, Captain Branch was assigned to the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base, Republic of Vietnam, where he flew 228 combat missions in the F-100. A few years later, by now a Colonel, Branch returned to this theater and as Director of Operations for the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing, flew 35 combat missions in the F-4 into North and South Vietnam.Colonel Branch retired in 1978 and returned to Myrtle Beach. During his career he made one Atlantic crossing in the F-86 and 11 in the F-100, well as two Pacific crossings in the F-4.

This Market square, convenient to the all-important river, also hosted lively four-day fairs every April and October. The marketplace was an easy stop for goods coming by river from Charles Towne or more-distant ports, and trade with the interior was also robust. The success of this local commercial supported the development of surrounding settlements and Dorchester enjoyed a brief heyday. (Left picture): By depicting markets similar to Dorchester's, 18th- century artworks can help us imagine the activity of market day, held at this location every Tuesday and Saturday in the 1720s.

        "Description_full": "All summer, everyone came up here and lay in the sun and carried on, recalls Mary Ann Epps McCullough, who, along with other lifeguards in the 1940s, \"would swim to the dam and back every day.\" July 4 brought Aquatic Day festivities with races and a diving clown. Spectators cheered as lifeguards stood on boats, using bamboo poles to knock each other into the water. One year, 4th of July attendance totaled 1,400 people. All of this occurred in what was originally simply \"Reservoir 2.\" In fact, down near the boat dock, a coal-powered pump once sent water from here to Greenville's homes. Just as fashions have changed so have park regulations. Originally, this was a white-only facility. The park system even closed briefly rather than integrate. Then, in the early 1960s, \"whites would leave at 1 p.m. Blacks would arrive after 2 p.m.\" (quote from Ed Miller, Jr.).",

        "Description_full": "Conrad Ehrhardt was born in Weiterade Kuhrhessen Germany on December 13, 1832 and left home at the age of 19 to come to America. He came with only 25 cents in his pocket and skills that he aquired from the mills, in which he had worked, in Germany. To strengthen his knowledge and mechancial aptitude, he did extensive reading on all books involving engineering and machinery. Once in America, he joined with other Germans along the Little Salkehatchie River on the Moccasin Branch where he operated a farm and sawmill. A waterwheel fed by water from the dam, which they built and still standing today, powered the sawmill. After a fire destroyed the mill in 1860, he moved his family to the present site of Ehrhardt. Conrad was a very industrious young man. Without a water source, he built a boiler to power his new sawmill by steam. The mill proved to be very successful and it wasn't long before others flocked to Ehrhardt. As others arrived, Conrad saw the need for other services and built other businesses to meet the people's needs. Besides the sawmill, he built a planing mill, flour and gristmill, rice mill, cotton gin, buckle plant ( for horse harnesses ), and a general store which also served as the first post office in 1876, and subsequently, the first train depot. Now that his sons were older they could manage other businesses. Conrad then proceeded to convince the Atlantic Coast Line to build a railroad spur from Greenpond to Ehrhardt. With the completion of the railroad, Conrad began selling housing lots in the town and the town was incorporated in 1898. The incorporation set the tide for more businesses to come and Ehrhardt grew to over 1000 people by 1900. He was also a man with high Christian standards and a very generous person. He lived and practiced the standards of his own expressed words. \"Try to owe no man anything but goodwill and endervor to pay that to all.\" It was this goodwill that led him to make a covenant with God as he was traveling to America, to build a church in the area he settled with his prosperity. He donated 2 acres for the Ehrhardt Memorial Lutheran Church and retired its outstanding debt when it was completed in 1904. He built a 10,000 gallon water tower sixty feet high to provide water for town residents for a small fee. And finally, he donated land to the town of Ehrhardt for the use as a cemetery, to which, he became its 1st occupant on September 13, 1908. Subsequent to his death, a 2nd railroad line, The BE&amp;W, was started to provide transportation between Ehrhardt, Bamberg, and Walterboro (never finished) for the workers and merchants to do business with Ehrhardt. Ehrhardt provided significant shipments by rail of lumber products, as well as, growing agricultural &amp; fertilizer products. The Atlantic Coast Line loaded over 40 boxcars of watermelons on a busy day.",

In 1946, the name was changed to Connie Maxwell Children's Home as more dependent children were placed in care. Through this tender ministry, thousands of children and families have been provided hope and healing. East Side: Dr. and Mrs. J.C. Maxwell through their beneficence led South Carolina Baptist into the tender ministry of child care by their giving and leadership. By allowing God to work through their personal tragedy, the Maxwells have had a significant part in bringing hope and healing to children and families in their time of need. North Side: Twelve year old Susie Burton of Newberry County was the first child received into care at the infirmary on this site by Miss Rachel Reagan, Matron, May 22, 1892. By the end of the year, twenty six children were in residence and these have been followed by thousands who have received care and nurtured from a dedicated staff. West Side: Interest and support from the community of Greenwood enabled the location of the orphanage at Greenwood. Through the years, the community and institution have grown in stature and prominence. The Board of Trustees changed the name of the First Cottage on campus to Greenwood Cottage in honor of this relationship. Support and leadership continues to be provided from the community with a number of trustees and staff serving in this tender ministry through the years.",

Friendly ships could pass through a narrow opening in the barrier. Throughout the war blockade runners continued to slip by Union warships, bringing supplies the South desperately needed. Wary of torpedoes, as the early mines were called, ironclads patrolled near the forts but would not venture into the channel.",

        "Description_full": "Originally built in 1753, the building was constructed as South Carolina's first and only colonial Statehouse. From 1756 to 1788, the Statehouse was the seat of the Royal British Governor, the Colonial Assembly and the central meeting place for South Carolina politics. Struck by fire in 1788, the two-story structure was partially destroyed. The foundation and some exterior walls were preserved and used in the rebuilding effort that begun in 1790. The structure was expanded to include a third floor and additions to the east and west ends of the original Statehouse. President George Washington visited the unfinished building in may of 1791 as he searched for architectural examples he could use as a pattern for the White House. While in Charleston, Washington may have met James Hoban, who would become the architect for the original White House, built in 1792. Historians have noted that \"the similarity between the Charleston Statehouse and the first design of the White House is too strong to dismiss.\" In December 1792, the U.S. District Court began meeting in the newly rebuilt building, marking the beginning of its use of as a courthouse. S.C. General Assembly records indicate that the courthouse was greatly damaged during the Civil War bombardment of the city. The building sustained damage in the 1886 earthquake and during Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Restoration efforts returned the building to its original 1792 appearance, and the building was reopened on 2001. Courtyard History Evidence of a moat that surrounded Charleston from 1700 to 1718 was revealed in the western third of the courtyard. It appears that the city wall on the west side of colonial Charleston consisted of an earthen rampart with a wooden palisade at its crest. The use of the site from 1718 to 1739, when the moat was filled, is not documented. A 1739 map shows the site as part of a large public square dedicated in part to market activities. By 1753, the location had become the site of the S.C. Statehouse, and by 1768 the rear yard had been formally established as a walled courtyard containing a two-story dwelling, two single-story privies, a fire well/cistern, and a drinking water cistern. In the early 19th century, the circular drinking water cistern was filled and replaced by a rectangular cistern adjoining the rear wall of the building. The foundations of the dwelling and privies have been reproduced to show their locations. The location of entrances to the courtyard is unknown. Two additions to the courthouse, built in 1926 and 1941, were removed to return the courthouse to its 1792 appearance. (Drawing at right, shows Courthouse Square)",

The Plymouth which Johnny Mantz drove to win the first race is one of several historic cars on display with other racing memorabilia at the NMPA Stock Car Hall of Fame/Joe Weatherly Museum, which opened here in 1965 to honor the pioneers of NASCAR.",

Charleston Harbor's main ship channel&amp;#8212;the only deep water access to the port&amp;#8212;passes directly in front of the fort. Ships entering the harbor had to pass close under the fire of Fort Moultrie's guns. From the time of the American Revolution through World War II, the fort's position on the south end of Sullivan's Island was the key to defending Charleston. Today Fort Moultrie preserves the story of evolution of American coastal defense. Almost all of America's wars between the Revolution and World War II&amp;#8212;and peacetimes in between&amp;#8212;have left their mark here. Many remnants of those times can be seen in the fort today. A walk through Fort Moultrie is a walk through time. (captions) (bottom) A Civil War view from Fort Moultrie, November 18, 1863, Confederates held the fort. Union blockade ships and ironclad gunboats kept their distance. Fort Sumter, in the harbor to the right, was partially crumbled from Union bombardment. Compare this wartime scene painted by Conrad Wise Chapman to your view today. (upper right) This map depicts Charleston Harbor during the Civil War. Note Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter. Enemy ships entering Charleston Harbor faced a gauntlet of deadly crossfire between Moultire and Sumter. These forts, combined with other forts and batteries ringing the harbor, made Charleston an unconquerable Confederate stronghold during the Civil War.",

Fire from Fort Moultrie's guns helped force the surrender of Fort Sumter in April, 1861.Rifled artillery appeared shortly before the Civil War and changed coast defense drastically. Rifled guns shot harder, farther, and more accurately than smoothbore cannon and could demolish masonry forts such as Moultrie and Sumter - Union rifled guns pounded Sumter to rubble in 1863. To cope with rifled guns, the Confederates turned Fort Moultrie into a massive earthwork to protect their own heavy rifles and smoothbores.Civil War artillery were aimed with simple open sights.8-inch Columbiad rifled and bandedTo meet the threat of Union ironclad fleets, General Beauregard, the Confederate commander in Charleston ordered captured smoothbores to be rifled and banded. These guns fired solid iron bolts intended to pierce the armor plating.One cannon mounted in a fort was equal to several cannon mounted on ships.32-pounder smoothboreWhen the Civil War began in 1861, Fort Moultrie was armed with 32-pounder smoothbores and light 8-inch columbiads.

There were 16turnouts, or pull-offs for passing, on the line with watering tanks and woodsheds. Its name was changed to Denmark in 1893 in honor of a railroad official with Sound Bound Railroad. Denmark depot is still an active Amtrak station. Dairy in Denmark South Carolina Senator Stanwix Greenville Mayfield, a lawyer, was a major landowner on the south side of Denmark and his home was located on Carolina highway. Mayfield owned and operated one of the two largest dairies in town. Another major dairyman in Denmark, James B. Guess, was a producer of champion Guernsey cattle. Guess had around 400 head of dairy cattle and produced Golden Guernsey milk. Neither of the original dairies exists today. Dane Cultural Center Seating more than 700, this 1950's era movie theater was the largest in the area. After closing as a movie theater in the 1960's, it sat vacant for a few years.

Voorhees College Elizabeth Evelyn Wright, a 22-year old graduate of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, founded Voorhees College in 1897.Tuskegee Institute trained teachers to provide educational services to African-American communities that may be undeserved. Miss Wright received financial support from various groups including the Episcopal Churches throughout the country, African-American churches, and the Ralph Voorhees family from New Jersey. Locally, S.C. Senator Stanwix Greenville Mayfield advised Miss Wright in obtaining land, and working with contractors. The result was Voorhees Junior College. Voorhees is one of the oldest African-American institutions of higher education in the state.",

        "Description_full": "For more than a decade, the 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron conducted routine A-10 training missions which included numerous deployments and exercises. That routine came to an abrupt end in August 1990, when the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed as one of the first units in the Persian Gulf to support Operation Desert Shield. When Desert Storm's air war began in January 1991, wing pilots initially flew against early warning radar and Scud missile sites. The 354th Tactical Fighter Wing also flew search and rescue missions; Captain Paul Johnson earned the Air Force Cross when he and Captain Randy Goff, also of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, rescued a downed Navy pilot 200 miles inside lraq. As the conflict evolved, the Wing turned its attention to deep interdiction missions and the Iraqi Republican Guard. Finally when the ground war commenced in late February, the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing performed the mission it had been trained to do before the war &amp;#8212; close air support. By any account, the devastation was considerable. By the end of the conflict, A-10s throughout the theater destroyed more than 950 tanks, 900 artillery pieces, and two helicopters in air-to-air combat. Despite the rout, the victory was not without cost to the Wing. Captain Stephen Phillis died while protecting his downed wingman, Lieutenant Bob Sweet. Later captured by the Iraqis, Sweet was repatriated after the war. The 354th Tactical Fighter Wing returned home from the Gulf in March 1991 and was redesignated the 354th Fighter Wing in October of that year.",

With a stalemate in the north, British General Henry Clinton set out to capture Charleston. In February 1780, he landed 8,500 men near Savannah and in April besieged Charleston.American General Benjamin Lincoln (right) brought in all available Continental troops and militia to the city and urgently asked for reinforcements. In response, North Carolina and Virginia sent veterans and drafted citizens to help. Colonel Abraham Buford commanded a Virginian unit, called the \"Third Provisional Regiment.\"A Doomed JourneyBuford's 350 Virginians marched south and arrived at Camden on April 25. Here, they received orders to proceed to Charleston and join Colonel Anthony White's cavalry. On May 6, Buford's men belatedly arrived at Lenud's Ferry on the Santee River in time to see White's destruction by Banastre Tarleton's (left) Legion. Six days later General Lincoln surrendered Charleston, over 6,000 men, and 154 cannon to Clinton. It was a disaster for the American cause.A Fateful DecisionBuford's regiment was the only remaining Continental unit in South Carolina. Joined by Governor John Rutledge (right) and a few cavalry and militia, Buford's regiment and valuable supply wagons retreated to North Carolina. General Cornwallis learned of Buford's retreat and sent Tarleton and his men in pursuit. He caught up with Buford here in the Waxhaws.What happens next remains a crucial turning point in American history �",

Canal &amp; Rail Road Company completed its first 133 miles of track from Charleston to Hamburg, the station here was called Ross, sometimes known as Ross's, Ross's Station, or Ross's Turnout. The post office established here in 1854 was called Elmville until Reconstruction. (Continued on other side) (side 2) (Continued from other side) The railroad, later the S.S. RR and by 1899 part of the Southern Railway, kept a station, a \"turnout\" or second set of tracks, and a water tower here for more than 100 years. It carried wood, turpentine, pulpwood, and livestock, and was instrumental in the town's development. The post office here was renamed Ross Station by 1875, then renamed Dorchester in 1903. The town, incorporated as Rosses in 1892, was incorporated again as Dorchester in 1912.",

The Dorchester Free School operated only a short time here. It opened in 1761 then closed during the Revolution and did not reopen for almost twenty-five years. In 1818 the school moved to the nearby town of Summerville.(Left picture): Students learned with limited supplies, such as this pencil found by archaeologists at the site. Students wrote handwriting lessons into blank copy books with simple lead pencils. (Right picture): Several girls received scholarships to attend the Dorchester Free School.

        "Name": "Dorn Mill- Production of Cotton Byproducts",
        "Description_full": "To persons familiar with the history of McCormick, the Dorn Mill stands as a symbol of the influence of the Dorn family in the region. It rests on land previously owned by Gold Mine \"Billy\" Dorn and Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the reaper. Cyrus McCormick influenced the location of the railroad and in 1881 donated 40 acres of land for a town. By 1883, this town had a population of 200 people, and cotton gins and shipping were the major economic activities. In 1898, the McCormick's conveyed this portion of land to the railroad for construction of a steam-powered cotton seed oil mill and cotton gin. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, the south became dependent on the one-crop economy of cotton. With the developing railroad system, which allowed more cotton to reach the marketplace, and introduction of textile manufacturing in the 1880s, the economy continued to be dominated by the growth, milling, and shipping of cotton products. Cottonseed, a byproduct of the ginning process, was viewed as having little value other than feed for livestock. Plant Modernization By the time of the mill's transformation into a highly engineered plant utilizing steam power, the energy saving methods pioneered by Oliver Evans (1795) were widely implemented. Corn and wheat moved by cups and belts (vertically) and screw conveyors (horizontally) through the milling process. The plant only required two employees, one to power the boilers and engines and the second the run the mill. The related lumberyard (owned by M.G. and J.J. Dorn) across the tracks to the northeast continued to provide sawdust/shavings as fuel for the steam plants. When the milling production ceased in the 1940s, the steam engines powered the cotton gin into the 1950s. Loss of Productivity Planters continued to meet the industrial demands and paid little attention to land conservation practices which reduced the natural productivity of the soil. In 1919 the boil weevil introduced yet another disastrous problem. Diversification In response to the destruction of the main money crop, farmers finally made efforts towards crop diversification and livestock production. In the early 1920s, M.G. &amp; J.J. Dorn (great-nephews of \"Billy\" Dorn) converted the mill for the production of meal, flour, and animal feed. New Products The cottonseed oil industry attained commercial importance in the South in the 1880s. The industry used the seed (a by product of cotton ginning) to produce marketable commodities such as: seed hulls for stock feed or fuel; linters for stuffing mattresses and pillows; and crude seed oil refined as edible oil.",

The Dunean Mill village included 585 houses, an elementary school, three churches, a company store, a community building, a gymnasium, and a baseball field. Its Y.M.C.A. was the first in any mill village in S.C. In 1935 the mill switched to rayon and other synthetic fibers. It was for many years a division of J. P. Stevens &amp; Company.",

Francis Marion took control of the Williamsburg Militia in August 1780 until the following spring, a network of camps in the area where the Great Pee Dee, Little Pee Dee, and Lynches Rivers meet formed a base of operations for his campaign to undermine the British occupation of South Carolina. From here, Marion attacked vital supply lines between Charleston and Camden and worked to neutralize the area�s loyalist militia forces.Sometime in early 1781, Marion ordered Col. John Ervin, a leader of the Whig militia on Britton�s Neck, to construct a redoubt, or earthen fortification, here at Dunham�s Bluff. The redoubt served as a lookout post to monitor traffic on the Great Pee Dee and as a defensive position against light opposition. A large campsite located a short distance from here housed a garrison of militiamen.A generation after the Revolutionary War, South Carolina�s official geographer wrote that &amp;#8220;by having control of the rivers, [Marion] could be abundantly supplied with provisions, and his post completely inaccessible except by water.&amp;#8221; While probably exaggerating the extent of Marion�s strength, the statement does reflect the way he attempted to use the natural environment to his advantage ~ and the strategic importance of the area�s river &amp;#8220;highways&amp;#8221; to all sides of the conflict in the South Carolina Lowcountry.",

Tracers continued to serve aboard Essex-class carriers until 1976 ( the hanger deck was too shallow for the 18+ft. high Hawkeye).

They settled nearby, soon became wealthy through the Indian trade, and conducted an illegal trade in Indian slaves and with pirates. The Goose Creek Men formed a faction opposing the Lords Proprietors between 1670 and 1720.

He supplied cloth, tools, gunpowder, lead, and rum to the soldiers, Indians, slaves, and settlers who passed through Ninety Six on the way to or from Charleston and the Cherokee villages. Representatives of the British colonial government often came through here, as well. As the backcountry population grew, so did violence between settlers and Indians. Indian attacks were often precipitated by the French, trying to wrest South Carolina from British control. In October 1759, British Governor Lyttleton formed a militia to protect settlers against Indian attacks. He searched for \"a proper Place to build a Magazine and Stockade Fort.\" At the crossroads of Ninety Six, he found Gouedy's post. Lyttleton commandeered Gouedy's house, barn, and outbuildings, enclosed them in a 90-foot-square stockade, and garrisoned his militia. Renamed Fort Ninety Six, this was the site of at least two dramatic Indian attacks in 1760. By the end of 1761 the British and Cherokee negotiated a truce. As the town of Ninety Six developed near the Island Ford Road, Fort Ninety Six was abandoned and all traces of it disappeared. Gouedy prospered, eventually owning over 1,500 acres of land in Ninety Six and 34 slaves until his death in 1775. An account of the March 3, 1760 attack appeared in the South Carolina Gazette: ...about 240 or 250 Indians attacked the Fort...and fired upon it for 36 Hours, without scarce any Intermission, even during the whole Night, but never came within 60 yards of the Stockade, except one fellow, who was killed and scalped, and whose body was given to the Dogs, and his Scalp hoisted along-side of the Colours, to provoke the Enemy to come nearer.",

        "Description_full": "Present-day Edgefield County was first settled in the 1750's, then a portion of a vast unsettled region of virgin forests, abundant wildlife and Indian tribes. From the time of the first settlements through the period of the American Revolution, this area was part of the Old Ninety Six District which included all of the northwestern portion of South Carolina. During most of this period there were no courts, law enforcement or local government. In 1785, immediately following the Revolution, the state legislature addressed the lack of governmental structure by dividing the Ninety Six District into smaller counties, including Abbeville, Laurens, Newberry and Edgefield. At that time, Edgefield County was far larger than it is today, encompassing 1,720 square miles. The seat of government for this broad district was located near this spot on an \"Old Cherokee Path\" which was the approximate geographic of the district. The \"Publik Lot\" was identified as early as 1785, and a \"gaol\" (jail), clerk's office and courthouse were built during the next several years. However, it was not until 1792 that Arthur Simkins, a prominent settler and political leader, officially conveyed to the \"Judges of Edgefield County Court\" the 2 1/4 acres where the Town Square and Courthouse are now located. In the last half of the 19th century and early in the 20th century, as citizens demanded more local political control, the counties of Aiken (1871), Saluda (1895), Greenwood (1897), and McCormick (1916) were created, taking substantial parts of Edgefield County. Today, Edgefield County encompasses only 481 square miles, roughly one-forth of its original size.",

        "Description_full": "Ehrhardt Hall was built in 1903 with Victorian style architecture. The owner, Dr. James Haynes Roberts, born March 2, 1863, was originally from the Allendale area. Following in his father's footsteps, who was a self taught dentist and 2nd lieutenant in the Confederate Army, James graduated from Medical College of Charleston in 1887 after graduating from the Citadel in 1883. After beginning his practice in the Allendale area of Barnwell County, he decided to relocate to the booming town of Ehrhardt after his 1st wife, Laura Barber Roberts had died with their 2nd child. He purchased a large farm tract with her inheritance and processed lumber from the farm to build this house on a separate parcel of 3&amp;#189; acres.The large support beams were made from pine and exterior siding, from cypress. It has 6 bedrooms with private bathrooms, as well as, formal living room, formal dining room, large kitchen, and 2 guest &amp;#189; bath. James and his 2nd wife, Laura Furman Roberts, occupied the house with their 6 children. Dr. Roberts used the front downstairs bedroom for his medical office and treatment room. If one of his patients required overnight attention, they used the upstairs bedrooms. The wrap-around porch became the waiting area. Having been very well received in Ehrhardt, James persuaded his brother, Robert, to build the house across the street , which was completed in 1908. Subsequently, he donated the land next to it, to the Methodist Church, which named the church, St. James Methodist Church, in his honor. James became very active in the town's leadership, church leadership, and businesses. He opened a pharmacy on the main street. Later, he became the first person to sell house lots to African-Americans. Consequently, the southern suburbs of Ehrhardt are often referred to as Robertsville. Then suddenly in 1920, after treating patients for extended periods of time with the Spanish Flu, he succumbed to a heart attack on July 18. 1920. Family members occupied the house until 1987 when it was sold for conversion to a Bed and Breakfast in 1989. The 2nd owner died shortly after, in 1984. The current owners, Shirley and Frank Ogle began operation in 1988.",

In keeping with its agricultural heritage, Emerald Farm continues to raise livestock, harvest hay, pecans, herbs and fruit on a small scale. What makes Emerald Farm so special is that we offer a hands-on educational facility providing visitors with the opportunity to learn about the wonders of nature and the relationships among the resident species, from the goat to the honey bee. in addition to the natural wonders, visitors can tour the soap factory where our all-natural Saanen soap is made. Other attractions include a ride on the Emerald Farm Express -- visit the Emerald Farm Model Railroad Clubhouse and see one of the largest model railroads in the southeast. Visitors can shop in the antique, natural food, hobby and soap stores, picnic in the pavilion, feed the fish or just relax and get closer to nature. Bicycle enthusiasts can watch out Saturday morning sanctioned ABA/BMX races. Our rides range in age from 3 1/2 years to 60 years. The Railroad and Greenwood: The history of Greenwood is embedded in the Railroad. The community grew up around the tracks forming one of the widest main streets in the state. The Farm's love of the railroad is evident when you visit the Emerald Farm Station. Out antique train is a \"1957\" limited edition, built in Salt Lake City, Utah. It will take you on a fun-filled ride. Watch for the authentic railroad signals. Exceptional Model Railroad Layout: Visit the Emerald Farm Model Railroad Club, home of one of the largest layouts in the southeast. Club members have shared their love of the railroad through the magnificent world they have created in two scales. Upstairs, visitors can step back in time, listen to the whistles blow, and see the smoke billow from the engines. Goat Milk Production: Our Saanen Goats, a Swiss breed of dairy goat, are noted for their gentle disposition and large milk production. On the average, they each produce 8 to 10 pounds of sweet milk per day. Goat milk is one of the healthiest products for those people with digestive sensitivities. Goat milk produced at Emerald Farm is used to make our all natural soaps, lotions and body products. Goat Milk Products: The Farm produces wonderful all natural soaps from the Saanen Goats milk. A gallon of goat milk yields approximately 100 bars of soap. In 1988 the Farm developed its soap formula based on an old process, refining and carefully combining only the finest all natural ingredients. The products contain no dyes, preservatives, or artificial fragrances. Each bar contains one-third whole gold milk and is molded in a specially designed form and packaged in environmentally safe material.",

If you lived here in the 1700s, you would have seen these woods give way to farmland. By the time Patriot troops arrived to camp nearby in 1781, there were open fields dotted only by tree stumps. Loyalists in the town, hoping to keep the approaching enemy in view and deny them cover in the woods, had cut down trees for up to a mile in each direction. Pre-settlement This region is home to many American Indian groups, including the Saludas, Waterees, and Congarees, who hunt nearby. Plants: Dense forests of oak, hickory, elm, locust, and poplar. Animals: White-tailed deer, turkey, squirrel, rabbit, fox, raccoon, beaver, muskrat, bison, quail, wolves, and panthers. 1730s-1750s The Cherokee predominate, but white traders, hunters, and trappers come into the area from Charleston. Early settlers include English, Irish, Scotch-Irish, French Huguenots, and Germans. Hostilities erupt between the Cherokee and white settlers. Plants: Less dense, area burned and cleared for farming wheat, corn, indigo, and flax. Fields are used for grazing. Animals: Ample wildlife, including deer, rabbit, squirrel, fox. Small farms support cattle, hogs, and sheep. 1780s Ninety Six is occupied by Loyalist troops. All land in and around the town is cleared. The town is burned and abandoned in 1781. Plants: Indian corn, oats, hemp, cotton, flax, and indigo are planted in fields outside the town. Clusters of hickory, oak, and black walnut trees grow beyond the settlement. Animals: Farm animals graze in pastures. Hunting grounds are sparse and more remote. 1850s-1960s The land around Ninety Six is used for agriculture until the 1960s, when Greenwood County creates a historic site at Ninety Six. Plants: Cotton is the dominant crop. Animals: Farm animals graze in pastures and wooded areas are occupied by deer, raccoon, rabbit, and squirrel. 1970s-present Extensive archaeological excavations of the battlefields are undertaken in the 1970s. The site becomes a national park in 1976. Native plants and animals are protected. There is a second growth of forest where land had been cleared in 1780. Plants: Winged elm, black walnut, pine, red maple, redbud, poison ivy, and Virginia creeper. Animals: Deer, raccoon, rabbit, and squirrel.",

Rutherford, an African-American businessman born a slave, taught school, then made lodge regalia and supplies and briefly co-owned a local cigar factory. (Reverse text) The Rutherford House was built in 1924-25 for Carrie Rutherford, daughter-in-law of W.H. Rutherford. Her son Dr. Harry B. Rutherford, Jr. (1911-1980) and his wife Dr. Evaretta Sims Rutherford (1910-1978) were prominent educators, he as a teacher and principal and later a dean at Benedict College, and she as a professor and department chair at Benedict College and Howard University. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.",

In 1776, a flag with a silver crescent on a blue field flew over the palmetto log fort on Sullivan's Island, now the site of Fort Moultrie. In a key Revolutionary War battle, the small garrison of the palmetto log fort repulsed an attack by British warships; the white palmetto tree on the blue field commemorates this battle.The flag was officially adopted in 1861 and is still used today.(Upper Right):The second official Confederate flag, called the \"Second National,\" replaced the first banner in 1863. It flew over the fort until Confederate troops withdrew from all Charleston harbor defenses in February 1865.(Lower Right):The United States flag at the far right was raised in February, 1865 when Union forces reoccupied the fort at the end of the Civil War.

The community was renamed Page�s Mill, and in 1877 a post office was opened with J. N. Page as its first postmaster. After the railroad came through this area in 1900 the town of Page�s Mill grew from the mill, general tore, and post office toward the railroad tracks. The town of Page�s mill was incorporated February 26, 1907. The Ford�s Mill / Page�s Mill community, part of Marion County since the county was created in 1798, became part of Dillon County when that county was created in 1910.

During the Revolutionary War, the British army first occupied the plantation in July 1781, turning the mansion, known as Colleton House, into a hospital and armory. Over the course of the summer, British troops (and probably black slaves from the area) fortified Colleton House with an abatis ~ a row of sharp stakes pointed outward to defend against an attack ~ and constructed Fort Fairlawn about half a mile away. Of primarily earthen construction and garrisoned by about fifty soldiers, Fort Fairlawn was designed to guard the plantation�s Cooper River landing.In September 1781, the plantation was an important staging ground for the Battle of Eutaw Springs, and afterwards it was one of the few posts outside of Charleston where the British maintained a strong presence. On November 17, when Whig militiamen under the command of Col. Hezekiah Maham and Col. Isaac Shelby attacked Colleton House, the outnumbered troops inside Fort Fairlawn made no move to defend their comrades. On November 24, the British abandoned the fort.Among the few Revolutionary War structures in South Carolina that are still visible, the well-preserved remains of Fort Fairlawn are currently under private ownership",

In this building Calhoun developed and set forth his most historically significant constitutional arguments and political theories. Vice-President John C. Calhoun moved to the Pendleton District from Washington D.C. in 1825 and settled into the Presbyterian manse \"Clergy Hall.\" After serving in the U.S. House of Representatives and as Secretary of War under President James Monroe, Calhoun had been elected to the vice-presidency under John Quincy Adams in 1824. He later christened his renovated Greek revival home \"Fort Hill\" and made it his permanent residence for the rest of his life. At Fort Hill in 1828, Calhoun anonymously penned \"The South Carolina Exposition and Protest,\" outlining his political theory of nullification. In July 1831, he published his famous \"Fort Hill Address\" publicly signaling his doctrine of states' rights. Calhoun resigned as vice-president under Andrew Jackson in December 1832 during the nullification crisis. Calhoun was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1832. His oratory in debates with fellow senators Henry Clay and Daniel Webster earned them the name \"The Great Triumvirate.\" Calhoun's service in the Senate was interrupted briefly while he served out a term as Secretary of State for President John Tyler, which included overseeing the annexation of Texas. On March 30, 1850, Calhoun died in Washington after serving almost continually in public office for forty years. Calhoun's major books A Disquisition on Government and Discourse on the Constitution were published posthumously. The Fort Hill plantation estate is a National Historic Landmark. The complex is preserved as an historic house museum in accordance with the will of Calhoun's son-in-law Thomas G. Clemson and is furnished almost entirely with original family artifacts. Restoration made possible by a generous gift from Archie Shaw Dargan (Class of 1949) and Caroline Sligh Dargan, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in memory of his uncle, George Edwin Dargan, Esq.",

That mortar shot from Fort Johnson was the signal for Confederate batteries around Charleston Harbor to open fire on Fort Sumter. The Civil War had begun.(Caption under Illustration at Right):South Carolina troops man batteries at Fort Johnson, April 12, 1861. After Fort Johnson's opening shot at 4:30 a.m., all the Confederate batteries opened fire and bombarded Fort Sumter for 34 hours, firing more than 3,000 shells. Fort Sumter fired back with little effect. The Union commander, Major Robert Anderson, would not risk his men on Sumter's open parapet to man the largest guns. On April 13, Confederate shelling endangered Fort Sumter's powder magazine and Anderson surrendered.",

Officials in San Augustine sent a work party of thirty slaves to help rebuild the fort, but the garrison instead built a new fort on the marsh edge, which they also called San Marcos. The water-filled moat of this new fort is still visible. San Marcos (II) was the last Spanish fort at Santa Elena. To prevent it from falling into French or English hands, when the colony was finally abandoned in 1587, it was burned.",

The fort's is now dominated by Battery Huger, a huge, black, concrete artillery emplacement, built in 1898-1899.The army used Fort Sumter for coastal defense until the end of World War II. Designated a National Monument in 1948, Fort Sumter today reflects one hundred years (1830s-1940s) of military activity.In 1861, newly built Fort Sumter (right) was an imposing, three-tier, brick fortress designed for 135 guns and 650 men.By August 1863, Fort Sumter (right) showed the effect of Union shelling. During the longest siege in U.S. military history, Union batteries bombarded the fort for 20 months (1863-1865), pounding it into a mound of rubble.",

        "Description_full": "Assigned to hold all of eastern South Carolina but with only a small force at his disposal, Col. John Watson needed to build a fort to protect the vital transportation corridor between Charleston and Camden, the British inland headquarters. The spot he chose was a forty-foot-high, flat-topped pyramid ~ a religious and political abandoned a few decades earlier by the Santee Indians ~ that overlooked both the Santee River and the main Charleston-Camden road. With a wooden palisade on top of the earthen pyramid and three rows of abatis ~ sharp stakes pointed outward to defend against an attack ~ on its slopes, Fort Watson commanded the surrounding lowlands. In late February or early March 1781, Brig. Gen. Thomas Sumter tried unsuccessfully to take Fort Watson. On April 16, Brig. Gen. Francis Marion, reinforced by Continental troops under the command of Lt. Col. Henry &amp;#8220;Light Horse Harry&amp;#8221; Lee of Virginia, laid siege to the fort. But with few of the tools they needed and unable to deprive the defenders of a water supply, the Whigs feared a prolonged standoff. One of Marion�s officers, Lt. Col. Hezekiah Maham, proposed building a wooden tower from which they could fire down onto the fort�s British and Loyalist defenders. The plan worked. Facing Marion�s riflemen in the tower, the British commanding officer, Lt. James McKay, surrendered Fort Watson on April 23.",

One room schools of this type were common throughout Anderson County, with potbelly stoves for heat, natural light for illumination, and outhouses. All grades were taught in the same room at the same time. Books were shared, discipline was severe, and oral repetitions of lessons was the common method of teaching. Schools were racially segregated. The Frierson School originally stood on the corner of West Whitner and I Street. In 1983, the structure was donated to Anderson Heritage Inc., and for its continued preservation it was moved to a new location in the vicinity of Crayton Street and Roberts Street. Eventually, the Frierson School was moved to the Anderson County Fairgrounds and stood there until the fairgrounds were sold to Anderson University. In 2009, the Frierson School House was donated by Anderson Heritage Inc. to the Anderson County Museum. The school was moved to its present location in August 2009.",

        "Description_full": "Provided by Members of the Class of 2005 In memory of September 11, 2001 our first day of class [Left]: In the early hours the news broke, the truth uncertain, the implications unfathomable We continued on, not knowing the world was changed forever Afternoon, our adrenaline slowed to the freezing point With heavy souls, realizing our world had changed forever As the days slipped by and the heroes emerged, we grew to realize the triumph born on the day that changed the world forever Victory is achieved only through struggle, heroes arise only in the midst of trials, experience is of use only it if is learned from Knowledge is valuable if acted upon Let's roll Ginny Wing With orientation just over, I had spent a week being wholly self absorbed, engrossed in making new friends and being away form home. The morning of September 11, 2001, reminded me that there was a bigger world than my manufactured campus. I think it was the first time my generation was ever challenged to look beyond ourselves. Suddenly we had to face the reality of war and we were no longer invincible. It was a sobering beginning to college and it caused me to re-evaluate my views. I cannot say that where I am today connects directly to those events but I can say that 9/11 and its aftermath drew me closer to my family and that the heroism displayed by a variety of \"ordinary\" individuals challenged me to seek opportunities in my own life to go beyond the easiest route. Eileen Gilbert Proverbs 17:17: \"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.\" During the tough times and the traumatic events people rose up to the challenge and dared to help one another. We all became \"brothers\" through one unifying event. Dylan Rebillot It wasn't something I could really fathom. What did this mean? Was this the beginning of attacks that were going to happen all over the United States? Who did it? Were we going to war? Other than sorrow for the people who died, I didn't know what to think. Greta Thielen 9/11 was tragic, but it connected every single person in this country in a meaningful way. It made us realize that we are vulnerable and that unity is essential to survival. Ryland Gore I don't know any more today what the future will hold than I did then. Yet somehow I maintain the same calm. Justine Sittema I remember returning from my first class of the year and getting in instant messenger only to see a message from my sister that said, 'If you haven't seen, turn on your TV right now!\" So I went down the hall and two or three girls from my hall were watching the disaster unfold. We all just stared at the TV not knowing what to do or say. This is one day I will always remember. It's like when I asked my parents what they were doing when they found out that Kennedy was assassinated and they responded, with explicit detail, exactly what they were doing. Betsy Fischer I shall always remember my first day of class at Furman - September 11, 2001. It was not only the beginning of the most important phase of my life thus far, it was the one and only time in my life that I've witnessed people of all races, backgrounds and beliefs come together as one American family. It was the first time that people of this country and institution came together in one accord in memory of those who had lost their lives. Shunta Harmom [Right]: We awoke knowing the day would be unique. Maybe even memorable - it was out first day as college students - but the true magnitude of the day remained unthinkable. I remember hearing the news. It seemed to surreal. As I wandered around campus, all TVs were on: students and faculty clamored around. Though I'd never experienced the \"average class day,\" I knew this day was unique. I attended my classes, but no recollections remain. I do, however, remember the weightiness I felt. As with any tragedy, there is great pain, but there is also hope. For the class of 2005, our career began with this tragedy, but after 4 years, we leave Furman stronger and more mature. We can arise courageous and strengthened. Sarah Pannell September 11, 2001, is the day our world changed forever. Two of the most visible icons of American strength and financial power, the Twin Towers in New York City, were reduced to a pile of rubble and death. The Pentagon, which is the nerve of our military, was also struck on this tragic day. Americans learned that vast oceans no longer protect us from the dangers of a new era. McKenzie Miller The present moment is upon us. May you rest in this moment, loving deeply, risking greatly, and living fully. For tomorrow is a gift we have not yet been given. RBP Through the terrors of these attacks we realized our common bond. For one moment in time there were no whites or African-Americans. There were no Protestants or Catholics. Nobody cared if you were a Democrat or Republican, or even if you were heterosexual or homosexual. What mattered was that we were Americans...and this is the American that I will always love and cherish. Keith B. Johnson The red, white and blue waved at half-staff by the time I pulled into the parking lot of Duncan Chapel Fire Department to apply for volunteer service. It was not until a few months later, while running my first structure fire, that I understood, and today, I proudly hang my helmet. Matt Malone It was my first birthday away from home, and I wondered if anyone would know that it was my birthday. Suddenly, the broadcaster came on the radio and announced that the Twin Towers in New York City had been hit by airplanes and had fallen. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. All of a sudden, it didn't matter that it was my birthday, nor did it matter that I didn't know very many people here. Everything else was trivial compared to the news on the radio. Joseph Hill It seemed like I was watching a movie. It was really hard to believe what I was watching on TV was actually happening in real life. Jacqueline Bishop Our first reaction was sadness. As the sadness wore off, anger took its place. I wondered why I was at Furman. I wondered why I did not go to West Point like my father did so I could fight back against the people that did this. Buckley Warden It's odd watching old movies now, because in day-to-day life I forget anything happened. But then you see the old New york skyline, and it makes you catch your breath - where there once were people and buildings is not just air. Mandi Carlton My mom told me that my sister had gone into labor and was in the hospital a couple of blocks from the Pentagon. When I heard that a plane had hit the Pentagon, I was stressed since my family was in the area, and I hoped and hoped that nothing more would happen. But it was so far removed from our current environment. So I was just kind of numb. I started to feel less numb when I heard that my sister had a boy and that they were safe. Hannah Bonner",

        "Name": "General Andrew Pickens Charted the Way",
        "Description_full": "The man most responsible for opening up the northwestern part of South Carolina by driving out the Cherokee and the British, during and immediately following the American Revolution War, was General Andrew Pickens. deeply religious but a fierce warrior, he was highly respected for his unflinching bravery under fire by the very enemy he conquered - the Cherokee and the British. General Pickens proved instrumental in several American campaigns against the British in the Revolutionary War, including battles of Cowpens, Ninety Six, and Kettle Creek. In fact, he and fellow South Carolina leaders Marion and Sumter have been called the great South Carolina Triumvirate who kept patriotic fires burning on the altar of liberty. They were joined by other fellow Carolina patriots as well, including soldiers who later became Pickens County citizens. The victory of Generals Morgan and Pickens over British Commander Tarleton at Cowpens in January 17, 1781 following the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780, effectively broke the back of the British offensive in the Carolinas and contributed greatly to the surrender of Cornwallis to General George Washington at Yorktown on October 18, 1781. Likewise, in skirmishes with the Cherokee in the years just prior to, during and after the Revolution, the skillful battle tactics and utter lack of fear on the part of General Pickens, contributed to victory over the Indians when pressures of new settler encroachment erupted into open conflict. Andrew Pickens was born on September 19, 1739 in Pennsylvania and immigrated with his family as a young man in the mid-1700s to the emerging frontier of upper South Carolina, where they settled eventually in the Long Cane area of Abbeville County. He married Rebecca Fluoride Calhoun, whose family had moved there from Virginia, and they began to rear their family. During those dangerous years frontier settlements endured attacks from Indians and from Tories and the British as well. Their dwellings were plundered and Mrs. Pickens on many occasions had to abandon their home and secrete herself and children for days while her husband was away fighting. They had six daughters and three sons, one of which would become governor of South Carolina as also did a grandson. General Pickens and his wife were very devout Presbyterians and were instrumental in building the Old Stone Church \"Meeting House\" near Clemson. This church was near land General Pickens acquired on the Seneca River containing 575 acres in 1784 which he named \"Hopewell.\" At Hopewell a year later he negotiated the final peace treaty with the Cherokee Indians during several days of meetings under the famous \"Treaty Oak\" on a high spot above what is now Lake Hartwell. This is today just south of and within earshot of the Clemson Golf Course and Madren Center. In addition to his military accomplishment, Andrew Pickens honorable served his state in important civil capacities as well. Following the Revolution, he was elected to the House of Representatives from Ninety Six District for the terms 1778-1780, 1781-1784, and 1786-1788. He served as the senator from Pendleton District in 1780-1793. He was elected to the 3rd Congress of the United States, and served in that capacity from March 4, 1795-March 13, 1795. He was also a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1790. He represented Pendleton District in the House of Representatives in the years 1798-1800 and 1812-1814. He declined a nomination for Governor of South Carolina. In late life he built a new home at Tamassee he called \"The Red House\" on a hilltop overlooking the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. Here he lived until August 11, 1817. when, full of years, he died peacefully, sustained by his simple faith and passed into the waiting arms of his savior for eternity. His burial, and that of his beloved wife, Rebecca, was at Old Stone Church, Clemson. The people of this area, revering the name of Andrew Pickens, for his distinguished service in war and peace, honored his memory when the new district was formed in 1828 by denoting it \"Pickens District.\" When it was divided in 1868, the people of the newly-formed county to the east of the Keowee, continued to honor his memory with our new County being named for him.",

        "Name": "George Washington Statue",
        "Description_full": "George Washington was born in Virginia on February 22, 1732. As a boy, he excelled in field sports, and though his formal education was limited, he exhibited skill in mathematics and surveying. In the French and Indian War, though only 23, Colonel Washington demonstrated unflinching courage and extraordinary leadership while under fire. During the Revolutionary War, General Washington commanded the Continental Army against superior forces. He devised the strategy of marching on the British in Virginia while the French fleet prevented an escape by sea. Washington trapped General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781, capturing 7,000 troops and winning American independence. As a Virginia delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, Washington, serving as the assembly's president, provided the moral authority and quiet leadership needed to facilitate compromises. Even at this time, he was known as a \"Founding Father.\" Following ratification of the Constitution, he was unanimously elected the first president and inaugurated in New York on April 30, 1789. President Washington toured the southern states in 1791. His enormous personal popularity served as a significant force in binding the former thirteen colonies into a single nation. On May 2, he landed at Prioleau's Wharf, one block south of the Exchange and Customs House. While in Charleston, President Washington met with numerous officials, planners and merchants, worshipped at St. Michael's and St. Philips's churches, spoke to various gatherings of citizens and attended several balls held in his honor. He also enjoyed the hospitality of two fraternal groups of which he was a member - the Masons and the Society of the Cincinnati. In his diary, he made several complimentary notes about Charlestonians. Referring to a concert held at the Exchange, Washington remarked that \"there were at least 400 ladies - the Number and appearance of which exceeded anything of the kind I had ever seen.\" Washington was unanimously reelected in 1792. Confronted with the competing philosophies of northern businessmen and southern planters, President Washington had a unique ability to recognize and promote the best of each. Leaving office after two terms, he established the tradition of peaceful transition of power. Retiring to Mount Vernon, he managed his plantation, entertained many visitors and remained a valued political and military advisor until his death on December 14, 1799. Of his many achievements, he is most loved for his honesty. George Washington's reputation for integrity is of such mythic proportions that school children continue to be taught that even as a boy, George Washington could not tell a lie. Back George Washington Returns to Charleston In 1881, on the 100-year anniversary of General Cornwallis' surrender to General Washington at Yorktown, the city of Charleston renamed its first public park Washington Square in honor of George Washington. More than 100 years later, and at the request of Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr., General William C. Westmoreland chaired a committee of fellow Charlestonians to raise the funds to erect a statue of George Washington in the park that bears his name. A native South Carolinian, General Westmoreland was one of America's most highly decorated and distinguished soldiers. His duty assignments included Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Commander of United States ground forces in the Republic of South Vietnam and Chief of Staff of the United States Army. General Westmoreland led troops in 17 battle campaigns in three wars. Sixteen countries decorated him for his extraordinary military service and five institutions of higher learning conferred various honorary degrees upon him. General Westmoreland's sincere commitment to duty and service to his soldiers, state and country are the essence of this outstanding South Carolina soldier's life and career. On the afternoon of December 14, 1999, numerous Charlestonians gathered to unveil the statue created by nationally acclaimed sculpter John N. Michel. The citizens of Charleston are grateful to the following who helped erect the statue: The Society of the Cincinnati of the State of South Carolina, the Washington Light Infantry, the South Carolina Legacy Trust Fund, the City of Charleston, Charleston County, the Society of the Descendants of Washington's Army at Valley Forge, Sons of the American Revolution, Wachovia Corporation, and a list of 66 names.",

        "Description_full": "Georgetown�s Industrious Past Port of Georgetown Indigo was first introduced to the area around the 1740's and served as Georgetown's first principal cash crop. Taking advantage of British bounties for indigo, highly prized as a clothing dye in Europe, an elite class of indigo plantation owners and merchants evolved and formed the Winyah Indigo Society, which in 1755 established one of the first free schools in America. The Revolutionary War brought an end to the indigo trade with England and eventually indigo was replaced by rice. The turn of the twentieth century brought much needed prosperity to Georgetown. Lumber became a big industry in Georgetown in the late 1800's. By 1913, the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company, located in the bend of the Sampit River, was the largest lumber mill on the East Coast. In 1936, International Paper built a mill in Georgetown, which grew to be the largest paper mill in the world. In the late 1960's, the steel mill was built on the site of the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company. Both mills are still in operation. Georgetown County also is home to more than 100 other businesses and industries that manufacture everything from additives for the cosmetic industry to polyethylene liners for landfills.",

From this altitude, gravity carried the water into town with no need for a pump. However, a valve was needed to control the flow out of the lake. This stone structure was built to house the necessary mechanism. The valve inside, similar to that which now controls the outflow of Lake Placid, is merely a combination of simply machines. Nevertheless, time has left it inoperable.",

        "Description_full": "A battalion of loyal Americans stood battle-ready on the spine of Kings Mountain above you. Lord Cornwallis' powerful army had ground its way north from Charleston with an unbroken string of British victories. Throughout the summer of 1780, His Majesty's Inspector of Militia, Major Patrick Ferguson, had successfully convinced thousands of Carolina men to take up arms to defend the government under which they had been born and raised. Now Ferguson and 1,000 loyalists - one third of the King's army south of New York - had taken their stand on this ridge, primed to finish off the rebels gathering around them. In the background of the marker are depictions of the Tory soldiers. Most of the Tories who fought here came from the Carolinas. Just like the Whigs, they had no military uniforms. A green sprig of pine in their hats was their only identification. Loyalists militia trained long hours to master handling Brown Bess muskets. Like their redcoat instructors, they expected their bayonets to carry the day on any battlefield. Nine-tenths of Ferguson's force here were Carolina Tories. Only about 120 provincial soldiers wore the redcoat here. These troops were men from Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey who had joined the British army early in the war.",

In 1781 after a bloody battle at nearby Windy Hill Creek, four wounded Tories sent inland from Charleston by General Banastre (the Butcher) Tarleton were left in the care of two comrades who had orders to bury them when they died. Luckily, Native Americans found them and took them to their secret, sacred healing springs. Six months later the Charleston garrison was astonished by the reappearance of the six men. All were strong and healthy. (Reverse text) Ownership of the springs passed from the native &amp;#8220;Indian&amp;#8221; tribes who revered them to Nathaniel Walker, who bought them with corn. The site passed through several hands until it was acquired by L. P. Boyleston. On July 21, 1944 he deeded the land and springs to GOD. The waters, by analysis are exceptionally pure and contain healthful minerals. People today, as in the past, believe they truly are Healing Springs.",

Later, owner George Hendricks added an ice plant. In 1985, Joyce and Leroy Stewart purchased the land across the creek from the original site and built the present replica of the earlier mill. Two other restored mills are located nearby, north of Pickens: The Hagood Mill and the Meece Mill. Grinding Corn at Golden Creek Mill The Stewarts assembled parts from around the country and purchased the grindstones in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1987. Mr. Stewart and his uncle constructed the millrace and had a 14-foot metal waterwheel constructed. The mill began grinding corn in 1990. The Stewarts sell the corn meal and other related items in their gift shop. Hagood Mill Hagood Mill is a restored and fully operational mill located north of Pickens Highway 178 and is operated by the Pickens County Museum of Art and History.

        "Description_full": "The Cadet Life Garden is dedicated to a special period in Clemson history. From its foundation until 1956, Clemson was an all-military college, one of seven in the nation. The student body was organized as a Corps of Cadets under a regular army Commandant. All students wore uniforms, attended military classes, practiced military drills, lived in barracks, marched to meals in a common mess hall, and most attended military summer camp at a US Army post - all the while working towards a college degree in their chosen field. Most were commissioned as officers in the US Army Reserve Corps on graduation, and many saw active duty with the military in foreign wars. During those sixty years, 12,314 students graduated, nearly 10,000 became Reserve Officers, about 5,600 saw active military service, and 335 died or were missing in action while fighting for their country. Life as a cadet was far different from that of present-day students at Clemson. The purpose of this garden is to portray and explain the customers and traditions that were unique to cadet life. The Guardroom and Guardroom Bell Atop old No. 1 Barracks, high above the Guardroom three floors below, the Guardroom Bell was at the very of cadet life. The Guardroom was always manned by cadets assigned by the top cadet officers: two \"rats\" (freshmen) for running errands, the Corporal of the Guard (a sophomore), th Officer of the Guard and Officer of the Day (seniors). Their duties were to answer the only barracks telephone and to relay messages to cadets, to provide visitors with information and help, to maintain order, to ensure that the bugler sounded his calls on time, and to ring the Guardroom Bell for all formations and for the first class of the day. All campus life marched to the tune of the Guardroom Bell, the same bell you see here. It was first rung in 1893 when the No. 1 Barracks was completed, and was deactivated in 1954 when No. 1 Barracks was razed to make room for modern new dormitories. Clemson's Golden Tigers Given to honor all those cadets Attending Clemson Agricultural College From 1893 to 1956 Who so well exemplify the Clemson Spirit. Class of 1942 Given in memory of all Classmates Who gave their Lives In the Service of their Country.",

This route passes the presumed location of Robert Gouedy's trading post, established in 1751, and the archaeological remains of Fort Ninety Six. It also leads you into an unmarked cemetery, where body-length depressions in the earth and rough stone markers indicate the final resting place of about 50 unnamed people perhaps from the colonial era. The old Charleston Road intersects this trail. One of the oldest Indian trails in upper South Carolina, and later a major colonial route between the town and the coast, it is sunken from are and use. Walking the Gouedy Trail allows you to see nature as the Indians and the first settlers did, and conveys a sense of what life was like here in the 1700s. Cherokee Attacks of 1760 In 1759 and 1760 Cherokee raids threatened the settlers of Ninety Six. Much of the violence was generated by a larger conflict between France and England, known as the French and Indian War. In late 1759, Royal Governor William Henry Lyttelton arrived here with militia, occupied Gouedy's trading post, and converted it into a fort to protect local settlers. The fort was attacked twice by the Cherokee, on February 3 and March 3, 1760. In the March attack, 250 Cherokee warriors besieged the fort for 36 hours, but the garrison held strong.",

These emblems are appropriately dedicated to the valiant dead of the armed forces who ventured far, fought bravely, and gave their lives to preserve freedom and liberty in our land. Together they lie here in mute testimony to the manner in which they lived, worked and fought to achieve the victories in order that America may life. In Memory of All World War I Veterans It was known as the Great War...the war to end all wars. We went \"over there\" to the songs and cheers of our countrymen, and marched right into the grim reality of twentieth century warfare. Poison gas, machine guns, tanks, aircraft and submarines were devastating innovations. We fought in trenches, on the sea and in the air. We help make the world safe for democracy...but it was only the beginning. In the Memory of All World War II Veterans This memorial is in honor of all of the World War II veterans who were involved in the fight for the freedom of America and the free world. Whether they fought in the Pacific or European theater, they faced a resolute and often brutal enemy; yet they possessed the inner strength and courage that kept them going on the beaches at Normandy, in the deserts of North Africa and on the islands of the South Pacific. The actions of those who were called to duty were probably best described by the words of Admiral Nimitz: \"Uncommon valor was a common virtue.\" In Memory of All Korean War Veterans They told us, \"We are going to have peace even if we have to fight for it.\" So we fought on the mountains of Heartbreak Ridge and waded ashore at Inchon. We froze in the winter and baked in the summer sun. At times, we were greatly outnumbered; but we still fought on and many of us gave our lives for Freedom...for Justice...and for Peace. In Memory of All Vietnam Veterans This memorial was erected in memory of the young individuals who sent to war as kids and lost their youthful dreams, and some their lives, for a cause -- freedom and honor -- and came back as men with the horrors of war instilled in every fiber of their being and were never given the respect and honor they so dearly deserved from the public of the United States government. God will one day judge our actions. Until then, He will shine on the lives of each veteran now and forever more because He was wit each of them in Vietnam. He was the only One that truly knows what they want through and are living with every day. In Memory of All Persian Gulf War Veterans \"I have seen in your eyes a fire of determination to get this job done quickly so that we may all return to the shores of our great nation. My confidence in you is total. Our cause is just! Now you must be the thunder and lightening of Desert Storm.\" -- General Norman Schwarzkopf",

Engines started, but before the ship could move away an explosion ripped through the Housatonic's wooden hull and she quickly sank.The H.L. Hunley disappeared after sinking the Housatonic. After searching for 131 years, in May 1995 the submarine was finally found 1,000 feet seaward of the Housatonic. The H.L. Hunley returned home on August 8, 2000, when she was recovered from her watery grave.Built from an iron steam boiler, the H.L. Hunley was 40 feet long with a crew of 9 men. The submarine's sleek design helped her glide through the water up to 4 knots. The air supply was limited. Once the candle went out after 30 minutes the crew quickly returned to the surface for fresh air.Two earlier accidents and the final sinking resulted in the death of 22 men who volunteered on this experimental \"peripatetic coffin.\"",

        "Description_full": "To break the blockade of Charleston Harbor, the Confederate submarine the H.L. Hunley set out to attack the Union warship Housatonic on the night of February 17, 1864. After ramming a 135-pound torpedo into the ship's wooden hull, the submarine quickly backed away.Seconds later a massive explosion shook the Housatonic, killing five crew members and sinking the vessel in 27 feet of water. The H.L. Hunley became the first submarine in history to destroy an enemy ship, but the Hunley and its crew never made it back to shore.(Caption on the Right): William Alexander's 1902 drawings of the H.L. Hunley. The Hunley was the third in a series of experimental submarines. The Hunley sank twice during tests, killing thirteen crew members. Built from an iron steamboiler, the Hunley was 40 feet long and carried a crew of nine men. The captain navigated while the other crew members worked the crank that turned the propeller shaft. The torpedo was attached to a long wooden spar on the bow.(Side Two):Discovering the HunleySince the night of the attack, the H.L. Hunley and its crew escaped detection by amateur and professional divers. In 1980, novelist Clive Cussler and a team of underwater archeologists began to search for the submarine in the outer Charleston Harbor. Fifteen years later they found what they believed to be the lost sub, buried in sediment in thrity feet of water four miles southeast of Fort Moultrie.Researchers from the National Park Service, the South Carolina institute of Archaeology and Anthropology, and the Naval Historical Center soon confirmed the discovery of the Hunley and partially uncovered and mapped the vessel. Test revealed that the Hunley has sufficient hull strength to allow for recovery, conservation, and eventual display at the Charleston Museum. (Side Three):The Hunley Recovery ProjectFederal, state, and private sector underwater archeologists teamed with engineers and divers from Oceaneering International to excavate and recover the H.L. Hunley. Oceaneering, a marine engineering company, has done recovery work on the USS Monitor and NASA's Liberty Bell 7 space capsule.In mid-summer 2000, the team excavated the sub and supported it with a continuous series of slings attached to a specifically built recovery frame. Each sling had a load cell to provide constant computerized monitoring of the hull stresses during recovery operations. Finally the Hunley was raised from its resting place and transported to a conservation facility in North Charleston, where the delicate work of conservation and preservation will continue for years.",

Embodied in this memorial are the Seraph's fore hatch, steering and plane wheels, her ship's bell and badge, and her periscope. Seraph is well remembered for her role in the secret entry into North Africa of Gen. Mark W. Clark when he headed a spy team which made a clandestine rendezvous with Free French leaders there in the critical days of 1942 immediately prior to allied landings on the North African Coast. During the same year this submarine successfully accomplished another secret mission that mystified the German Enemy. In this episode she was the vessel that permitted French Gen. Henri H. Giraud to elude the Germans who surrounded him in Southern France and escape to aid the Allied Cause. Since Giraud was at odds with the British, he insisted that he would make his escape only on an American submarine. No such vessel was then in the Mediterranean, so an American Naval Officer was placed in technical command of the Seraph. For a time she had two captains and operated under two flags, The American and Royal Navy Ensigns which fly above this monument to commemorate this unusual co-operation between two nations. Among the Seraph's many other historic missions was a gigantic ruse which saved thousands of allied soldiers' lives in World War II. A book entitled \"The Man Who Never Was\" describes this adventure, and a moving picture was based on the book. Another book, \"The Ship That Had Two Captains,\" deals primarily with the Giraud adventure.",

The Products of Industry Census records Hagood Mill as having produced 2,500 bushels of meal (140,000 pounds) and 200 bushels of flours (11,200 pounds) in the year 1870. For many years, the Hagood Mill and store were the gathering place where locals would meet to discuss topics such as politics, crops, the weather and other local activities. For many generations, the mill and store remained a for rural families and friends. Occupational, Craft and Architectural Traditions The Hagood Mill is one of the oldest known surviving gristmills still producing grain products in South Carolina. The Mill is located on Hagood Creek, formerly known as Jennings Creek, a tributary of Twelve Mile River. The last dam site is 1,650 feet from the mill, where water from the creek was originally diverted to the mill in an earthen headrace (ditch). Today water is pumped from the creek up to the headrace. The last 80 feet of the rate is made of wood. The wooden water wheel, 20 feet in diameter and 4 feet wide, produced 22 horsepower. The wheel and the mechanical components of the mill were rebuilt in the mid-1970s using as many original parts as possible. Restoration work continued in the mid-1980s and again in the mid-1990s. The ring gear is 18 feet in diameter and the two granite millstones weigh approximately 1,600 pounds each. At this site, traditional art and folkways of the people of Pickens County are presented: including the livelihoods and professions that Pickens County men and women used to support their families. Generations of farmers, loggers, millers, wood carvers, and other fine craftspeople as well as railroad, textile, and other workers have contributed to this unique sense of place and culture. Folklore and Folkways The Hagood Mill site if the home of Pickens County's \"Upcountry Folklife Festival &amp; Old Time Fiddlin' Convention.\" This celebration of music, food, traditional arts and living history takes place every September. Additional, the third Saturday of every month the site plays host to mini-events that, in addition to the mill operations, feature a variety of music, traditional food, living history performance, traditional arts, and folklife presentations. The musical heritage of the region, like the visual arts of the region, reflects the culture - the people, places and things - that have for generations defined \"what and who we are.\" Ongoing programming at the Hagood Mill takes advantage of the varied traditions of the region to interpret the culture of the region as well to entertain. [Reverse]: Leisure and Recreation The Hagood Mill with the Pickens County Museum, under the guidance of the Pickens County Cultural Commission, are actively engaged in contemporary tourism as a means of economic development for the county. One goal of this institution is to see that such development is carried out in a responsible manner and is able to entertain those with interest based in heritage, natural resource and cultural-based tourism while continuing to offer the same varieties of informative and entertaining programming for the local populace. Cultural-Based Recreation Hagood Mill will be a significant Upcountry destination for heritage and folklife tourism. The success of the site as a revenue-producing attraction will provide benefits to the educational programming of the Pickens County Museum System as well as the School District of Pickens County, supporting the teaching of South Carolina History. The numerous pre-historic petroglyphs at this site will be part of the new \"Petroglyph and Pictograph Interpretive Center.\" that will be in important resource to teach about the pre-historic cultures that abounded the Upcountry and are represented by the numerous works of rock art, carvings and case painting discovered throughout the foothills of this region. The diversity of cultural-based programming at Hagood Mill is designed to appeal to a wide audience - ranging from the \"average\" tourist to visiting specialists that are already highly knowledgeable about local history and pre-history. The goal of this site is to provide enlightenment, entertainment and knowledge; providing \"something\" of real interest to local residents as well as those that are \"touring\" the region. Trails The Old Mill Race Nature Trail partially followed the flow of the original millrace. General trail cutting and brush clearing has taken place, and several rest areas have been built. Plants and trees have been identified for upcoming signage and a sturdy covered footbridge crossing Hagood Branch is completed. Future developments along the trail is intended to reflect the native Cherokee culture. All identification of local flora will feature the Cherokee name along with the Native American uses for that plant. Additionally, plans for the trail include a pre-contact homesite, complete with a Cherokee winter home, summer home, simple sweat lodge and a Cherokee garden.",

By 1837 the Haile Gold Mine included a 5-stamp mill, with steel stamps or pestles that crushed ore into dust from which gold was extracted. Haile leased small plots to entrepreneurs who used slave labor to mine gold. (Reverse) The mine was not successful until the 1880s, when its owners hired Adolf Thies (1832-1917), a German mining engineer who perfected a new extraction process. A 60-stamp mill processed 100 tons a day, producing more gold than any mine east of the Mississippi. After a deadly boiler explosion in 1908, the mine closed in 1912. It operated briefly during World Wars I and II and the 1990s.",

        "Description_full": "In December 1781, Maj. Robert McLeroth and the 64th Regiment were conducting newly-arrived British army recruits of the Royal Fusiliers from Charleston to the High Hills of Santee. Learning of McLeroth�s movement, Col. Francis Marion led some 700 militiamen up the Santee River Road and surprised McLeroth near Halfway Swamp. McLeroth bought time to avoid a battle by proposing a staged combat, twenty men on each side, and then withdrawing his troops north toward Singleton�s Mill during the night. When Marion discovered McLeroth�s trick the next morning, he sent horsemen under Maj. John James in pursuit. Just beating the British to Singleton�s Mill ~ a large rice plantation and grist mill located ten miles north ~ James�s men seized the buildings and managed to deliver one volley before they realized that the Singletons were ill with smallpox. As quickly as they had come, the Whigs abandoned the plantation to the British. The next day Marion moved his men back down the Santee Road. British commanders in South Carolina were dissatisfied with McLeroth�s performance in the field, but several Patriot sources attest to his uprightness and generosity. After the skirmishing between Halfway Swamp and Singleton�s Mill, McLeroth took the wounded from both sides to a tavern, paid for two weeks� lodging, and left an army physician to care for them. When Marion discovered what McLeroth had done, he said to one of his officers: &amp;#8220;Well, I suppose I feel now very much as I would feel were I in pursuit of a brother to kill him.&amp;#8221;",

British warships blockaded Charleston, but never came within range of Moultrie's guns.Troubles with Britain caused Congress in 1807 to authorize a \"second system\" of forts on the Atlantic coast to guard harbors, river outlets, and seaports. Fort Moultrie III, completed in 1909, protected Charleston harbor.Forts such as Moultrie were designed to defend against wooden sailing vessels armed with smoothbore cannon.The fort had a hot shot furnace for heating solid shot. A red hot cannonball lodged in a ship's timbers could start a disastrous fire. After the War of 1812, America updated its coastal forts. In the 1830s and 40s we modified Fort Moultrie's parapet, bricked up the embrasures, and replaced its old cannon with 18-, 24-, and 32-pounder cast iron guns. At that time the entire fort looked about as this northwest bastion does now.(Diagram at the bottom lists the ranges of the various guns, but the text has faded)",

        "Description_full": "Historic Camden Revolutionary War Site is located at the original site of Camden, the oldest inland town in South Carolina. Established in 1733, colonial Camden emerged as the trade of the backcountry by the 1760s. On June 1, 1780, Camden�s citizens surrendered to General Charles, Lord Cornwallis and 2,500 British soldiers. For the next eleven months the garrisoned town served as the principal British inland post while the brutal 1780 - 81 Southern Campaign ravaged the Carolinas. Two major battles were fought nearby: the Battle of Camden (August 1780) and the Battle of Hobkirk�s Hill (April 1781). Commanders associated with Camden include American generals Horatio Gates, Nathanael Greene, and Baron Johann de Kalb, and British commanders Lord Cornwallis, Lord Rawdon and the infamous Banastre Tarleton. The British burned most of the town when they evacuated in May 1781. Undaunted, the citizens rebuilt Camden just north of here. This 107 ~ acre museum includes five historic buildings, two of which contain exhibits, reconstructions of several British fortifications unearthed during archaeological investigations, and the reconstructed Kershaw mansion, which served as British headquarters. Historic Camden is the starting point for your tour of the area�s Revolutionary War sites. You�re invited to spend a few peaceful hours where the British spent a rough year. ",

        "Description_full": "At 4:30 a.m., April 12, 1861, Confederate gunners fired on Fort Sumter and the Civil War began. After 34 hours of non-stop shelling, Sumter's Union garrison surrendered, and on April 14 the Confederates took the fort. Fort Sumter then became the focus of a bitter, four-year struggle as Union forces tried to regain the fort and control Charleston Harbor.Fort Sumter TodayFort Sumter today looks much different than it did in 1861. The top two tiers are gone, destroyed during the Civil War. And the fort's is now dominated by Battery Huger, a huge, black concrete artillery emplacement built in 1898-99.Used by the army for coastal defense through World War II, Fort Sumter today reflects more than one hundred years of military activity (1930s-1940s). The fort became a National Monument in 1948.Charleston's Historic PastNational Park Sites to VisitCharleston has played a rich and varied role in America's history, as a defender of America's birth, home to founding fathers, trade , ignitor of civil strife, and coastal defense link.Three sites that display key elements of Charleston's storied past are preserved by the National Park Service and can be visited.Fort Sumter, famous for the Civil War's opening battle, guards the entrance to Charleston Harbor. Reached only by boast, it was the focus of explosive conflict from 1861-65. Reduced to ruin by war's end, Fort Sumter was partially rebuilt and modernized, continuing as a military site until the end of World War II.Fort Moultrie, on Sullivans Island at the mouth of Charleston Harbor, was the site of a Revolutionary War battle in which patriot troops repulsed the invading British Navy. Guarding Charleston for nearly 200 years, Fort Moultrie traces American coastal defenses from the nation's birth through World War II.Charles Pinckney - patriot, statesman, and a framer of the Constitution - helped mold America in nearby Mt. Pleasant, part of Pinckney's coastal plantation, called Snee Farm, is preserved as Charles Pinckney National Historic Site. Features there provide a glimpse of America's early years.",

        "Name": "Historic Plants Garden-The Children's Garden",
        "Description_full": "Agricultural plants that were grown and sold by farmers are important to Greenville's history. For many years, most families in Greenville made their living by farming. Corn, Wheat and Oats In the early 1800s, corn, wheat, and oats were the most commonly grown crops in Greenville. These were turned into flour in a mill, then used to make foods and animal feed. After the Civil War, soil was poor, many men were lost, and families had little money or livestock. The 1866 harvest was poor, so many planters lost all they owned and left Greenville during that time. The railroads had come to Greenville, providing faster transportation than animals, so there was less need to grow grains for feed. As Greenville grew and developed a textile industry, cotton became the most profitable crop to grow. Cotton In Greenville's early years, cotton, the major crop in other parts of South Carolina, was not of great importance in Greenville. But by the late 1800s, cotton production was on the rise. Greenville was the state's third largest cotton-producing country by 1915. Countrywide production peaked in 1920, when manufacturing and the railroad brought new growth to the region. As cloth-making became industrialized in Greenville, cotton's importance grew. Cotton's high price in 1915 encouraged more farmers to grow. It seemed a promising crop, but many problems lay ahead. It was difficult to grow and harvest. Whole families worked together to plant, tent, and pick up a crop. The school year was scheduled around cotton's growing season as kids could help their families harvest. Prices dropped as cotton production increased, so farmers lost money. Boll weevils arrived in 1917 and threatened cotton to extinction, ans still the price dropped. The return of European production after World War II decreased demand, and the Great Depression of 1929 added to the troubles of the cotton farmer. Their costs rose while their cotton was being sold for less money. Relief was in sight, however. Through the Clemson Extension Service, Greenville County hired an agent who taught farmers modern farming techniques. Farmers learned new ways to grow corn and produce livestock, and a new peach industry flourished. Agriculture eventually declined in importance in Greenville as the modern city emerged. Tea The type of tea we most commonly drink in the South (iced tea) is made from the flavorful leaves of a variety of camellia (Camellia sinensis). Tea is the most consumed beverage in the world after water, and yet most of the tea we drink is not grown in the United States. The only tea farm in America is in South Carolina! On the island of Wadmalaw, 20 miles south of Charleston, tea has been grown since 1799, when a French botanist brought the first tea plants to America. You can find this \"American Classic Tea\" in grocery stores and try it for yourself! It is both the official White House tea and the Hospitality Beverage of South Carolina. Tea has a history even closer to home. Junius Smith moved to the Greenville District and decided to experiment with the growth of tea. He began to plant tea in 1848 on land about a mile from town owned by Dr. Charles B. Stone and then purchased 269 acres of his own on Golden Grove Creek and started his own tea farm. As you see here, teal still grows in Greenville. In autumn, it has small, fragrant yellow-white flowers. When you drink tea, remember that it is the glossy green leaves of this plant that create one of the world's most popular drinks.",

        "Name": "Historic River Cane",
        "Description_full": "River cane (Arundinaria gigantean) is the only native American bamboo, and it is the \"reed\" that gave the Reedy River its name. Found in flood plains throughout the southeastern United States, it is a member of the Grass family (Poaceae), and grows to over 25 feet in height. A smaller subspecies called switch or mountain cane (Arundinaria gigantea tecta grows to about 4 feet high. Like all grasses, river cane blooms and produces seeds, but only does so infrequently (sometimes as long as 50 years between blooms). Cane reproduces by spreading underground with rhizomes and putting up new shoots every 12 to 18 inches. Archaeological records indicate that Native American people began to use river cane nearly 9000 years ago. Because it is found in such a wide range of sizes and because it can be manipulated in a variety of ways, river cane was one of their most important plant species. It was used for arrows, spears, blowguns, baskets, sleeping and work mats, and even woven into the walls of lodges. Native Americans may have even planned the relocation of their villages around the abundance of river cane. When they began to deplete the canebrakes (thickets of river cane) near a particular village, they would begin nearly a year ahead to prepare for their new move to a lush and healthy canebreak. When they rebuilt their homes in the new location, they cut the black locust saplings in the canebreak for lodge poles and then cane to weave between the poles to pack with mud and form the walls. Early explorers of the southeast recounted seeing thick canebreaks many miles across. These canebreaks were likely maintained by fires set by the Indians who learned that fire killed off most competing plant species and made a healthier canebreak. Many species of animals thrived in the canebreak, such as bear and bison and even the Carolina Parakeet. Early white settlers grazes cattle and horses in canebreaks which was comparable to the finest pastures. While the great canebreaks are gone today, you can still find small canebreaks along rivers and streams throughout its range, and many people are again learning the value of river cane in preventing erosion of stream banks and providing wildlife habitat. Almost everywhere you see river cane today, there is evidence of Native American habitation nearby. Here, we have replanted historic river cane so that it will stabilize the river banks, be a home for animals, and be discovered and studied by the children who visit the garden.",

Over the next two decades the Garden Club, in partnership with the city, continued to protect, expand and develop the area. In 1975, a small house, known today as Falls Cottage, was acquired and restored. A master development and beautification project was begun in 1990 with city and garden club funds augmented with generous support from foundations, corporations, and individuals. Falls Park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, encompasses 26 acres with nature trails, landscaped gardens, a pond, expansion bridge, scenic overlooks, textile mill ruins, and historic informational plaques.

The Reedy flows 75 miles from its headwaters in Travelers Rest through Greenville to Lake Greenwood. Pioneer Richard Pearis built an Indian trading post at the Reedy River Falls over 200 years ago. The city of Greenville grew up around the site of Pearis' trading post because the Reedy's waters could power machines that ground corn into grits and wove cotton into cloth. The Reedy River helped make Greenville the \"Textile Capital of the World,\" when cotton factories lined its banks and streams. But the Reedy also carried away Greenville's sewage and chemicals from its factories. Pollution threatened the health of the river, killing fish in its waters and hurting birds and wild animals that lived near the river. Today, this park is part of an effort to stop the pollution, to clean the Reedy, and to protect the river that gave life to Greenville.",

Once part of a 1716 land grant, its name comes from Hobcaw, the Native American word meaning between the waters, and barony from land grant. Over the years, the barony was subdivided into 14 plantations, becoming part of the great Carolina Golf rice empire. Rice production was labor intensive, so cheap slave labor was used to clear swamps and grow the crop. The 1650's were the most profitable for Georgetown rice planters. During this period, Hobcaw Barony produced nearly six million pounds of rice in one year alone. After the Civil War, rice cultivation declined because of competition from western planters, and, ultimately, a series of weather events halted the growth in the late 1800's. Bernard Baruch, a native South Carolinian and financier, purchased the property in 1905 to use as a winter retreat. His daughter Belle later purchased the family property, and at her death, the Belle W. Baruch Foundation was created. The mission of the Foundation is to conserve Hobcaw Barony's unique natural and cultural resources for college level research in the fields of marine biology, wildlife and forestry.",

        "Description_full": "The rural 19th Century village began as a sparsely settled community in historic St. James, Goose Creek Parish of the Charleston District. Following the revolutionary War, increased numbers of settlers entered the parish's backcountry where it bordered on Four Holes Swamp System. Many of these pioneers indentured themselves to Charleston merchants who held state land grants. Agreements were made to clear and plant the land, erect log cabins, or \"harvest\" pine sap for turpentine. The sturdy, who preserved and survived malaria and yellow fever, amassed extensive land acquisitions. Bunch Ford Road (SC 314) [Marker picture included] provided passage across Four Holes to St. George Parish, Dorchester. The Old State Road (US 176) was an old Indian Trail that transversed the length of the settlement. It fell into the Old Gaillard Road (SC 27) that connected Charleston to Vance's Ferry on the Santee River. In 1800, Francis Asbury, a Methodist circuit rider and preacher, founded the area's first church around a stump pulpit. The church was located at the head of gate where tar and other naval products were processed. Through the years tar-gate became Target. Target Church was the of the religious and social life and the Target Community grew and prospered. In 1855, the first school attracted many students. After the Civil War, a Reconstruction School reopened in the Target Community. In 1823, increased stagecoach travel between Columbia and Charleston resulted in improved routing of the Old State Road. A more direct leg of road by-passed the Target Community. Also, in 1825, the Camden Road (SC 310) was constructed to fall into the new leg of the Old Stone Road. By 1827, Camden Fort Plantation was erected at this junction site, serving some 80 wagons around harvest time. Farmers quickly settled along these two new routes, Four ridges (\"hills\") crossed this section of the Old Stone Road. Holly trees were abundant. Mail arrived by horseback, twice weekly and the mail was addressed as Holly Hills - later Holly Hill. Visionary leaders saw the necessity for the settlement to have contact with more markets. In 1894, the state chartered the Eutawville Railroad to cross Four Holes Swamp. This 34-mile spur line connected Holly Hill, Eutawville, Vance, and Elloree to Charleston's then SC Railroad. In 1886, where the railroad crossed the Old Stone Road, the site for the rural hamlet of Holly Hill was defined. On December 1887, the village was chartered as the \"Town of Holly Hill\". In 1868 the districts in South Carolina became counties. Holly Hill was named in Charleston County, but in 1880, it was replaced through legislation to be in Berkeley County. By 1910, the citizens of the greater Holly Hill area successfully voted its annexation into Orangeburg County.

The same path leads from that back into the world. The walk thus becomes a living metaphor for the spiritual journey which can be shared by all people.

        "Name": "Honea Path-Pathways of a Southern Town",
        "Description_full": "Native American Trade and the \"Honey Path\" Town historians long debated the origin of the unusual name \"Honea Path.\" Some attribute it to settler William Honey, who purchased 200 acres northeast of town in 1788. Others say it refers to a Cherokee trading path that ran between the Saluda and Savannah Rivers. Before the arrival of Europeans, Native American groups traded goods throughout the region. Cherokee and Creek Indians later used the waterways and pathways to trade with Europeans. Former Honea Path residents recalled Cherokee Indians returning to the area to care for ancestral burial sites as late as 1855. The town's earliest name was \"Honey Path.\" A walk or drive in and around the town of Honea Path today reveals the town's history. Its historic houses, commercial and public buildings, and surrounding fields of crops and livestock tell the story of the community's growth. Chiquola Mill and Village Most prominent on the town's landscape is the Chiquola Mill and nearby mill village. Chiquola is distinctive among the region's textile mills, because it has remained in operation since its doors opened, and because of a tragic conflict between mill employees and owners in 1934. Chiquola was also famous for its highly competitive baseball teams, who fiercely battled those of other mill villages. Early European-American Settlement When the earliest settlers from Europe and within the United States came to the area, it was a true frontier. Honea Path's earliest European settler, David Greer, came from Ireland in 1794. Other early arrivals were Obediah and Jennie Shirley, who built a simple log plantation house around 1830. In 1848, M.E. Erwin established a farm, and built a mill for grinding corn and flour. This mill still stands, although its water wheels are now in front of the Jennie Ervin Carnegie Library, named to honor M.E. Erwin's daughter. The Rail Lines Honea Path's early success in the testile and agricultural industries relied on access to the railroad. Two different rail lines ran through town. In 1855, train tracks were laid directly behind where you are standing, and a second line arrived in 1911. train service allowed farmers of the area to specialize in cotton cultivation. Before the railroads came, residents were largely subsistence farmers and grew crops for their own consumption and produced many goods at home. The benefits of the railroad to the people of Honea Path were tremendous -- including not only shipment of crops, but regular mail delivery, new types of merchandise, and frequent visitors. [Reverse]: Small Town Life Memorable events and places of Honea Path included afternoon fellowship at train time, the handmade hat store operated by Maggie Brock, the Town Theatre, Rosa Cox Candy Store, the Old Watkins School, Blacksmith Shop, blackberry patches, Railway Station, Door to Door peddlers and knife sharpeners, quaint churches with ceiling fans, a public cannery, sun parlors, minstrels on Saturday night radio, teachers returning to boarding houses in late August, Coleman Field park in its \"Hey Day,\" preachers with frock tail coats, Queen Anne's lace at weddings, running water and a back yard well, and trash dump southwest of town in the direction of prevailing winds. Obediah and Jennie Shirley House Completed around 1830, the Obediah &amp; Jennie Shirley home encloses a circa 1790 log cabin. It is one of the oldest buildings in Anderson County. The Shirley family made many contributions to the success of the town. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places. Preserving the Past Many in Honea Path strive to remember their ancestors and to preserve the places that are part of the town's history. Descendants of many of the earliest town settlers still live in the area. Carnegie Library The Jennie Erwin Carnegie Library was built in 1908. Endowed by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, it was the smallest library in the state built with Carnegie funds. The library, an important part of the town's history, is also a repository of that history. Visitors to Honea Path can discover the town's history by visiting the town's people, its buildings, and surrounding farmlands.",

The treaty was signed on November 28, 1785. The Choctaw treaty was signed January 3, 1786 with Chief Yockenahoma and 30 other chiefs. The Chickasaw treaty was last, concluding several days later on January 10 with Chief Head Warrior Piomingo, who shared white beads as a token of peace and friendship.

        "Description_full": "Located in the of Historic Pendleton (1790), the building now housing the Pendleton District Commission was constructed in 1850 as a general store for Jesse Lewis. The business first came into the Hunter family in 1870 when it became \"Hunter and Long.\" Partner James Hunter bought full control of the business which passed through several generations of Hunter ownership, becoming known as simply \"Hunter's Store.\" Everything from A to Z -- apples to zinnia seeds -- could be purchased as Hunter's Store. \"Dry Goods\" such as shoes and clothing were sold alongside local produce such as fresh eggs, other foodstuff like flour and coffee, as well as farm tools and chicken feed. \"One-Stop Shopping\" is not a recent invention! In 1929 a new building was constructed next door and opened that year as the new Hunter's Store. The 1850 building was used for storage and workspace until the store ceased operation in 1962. In 1968 the Tri-County Pendleton District Commission bought the old general store and has used it since then as the Commission's headquarters, including a Local and Family History archives. The Commission installed the first plumbing and electricity in this building. Otherwise, few changes have been made to the structure which retains its original exterior appearance as well as the interior's wide board flooring and even the neat hooks in the high ceiling. Hunter's Store was a landmark business in Pendleton and continues to be \"the place to go\" today. The Resident Ghost For years, Commission staff members heard strange footsteps and noises from the second floor. The Hunter descendants confirmed that the building was indeed haunted. The story goes that in the 1890s the present-day library room was used as a caretaker's apartment. A local fellow who had imbibed a little too much liquid refreshment fall off his horse into nearby Eighteen Mile Creek and was \"fished out\" and put to bed in the caretaker's room. Left overnight in his wet clothes and with no heat, he was found dead the next morning after a sudden cold snap lowered the spring temperature below freezing. Apparently he still visits the site of his demise, in the process alarming staff members with loud noises and even an occasional appearance! Historic Pendleton In the fall of 1970, the entire town of Pendleton plus a small area extending into Pickens County was named to the National Register of Historic Places. Its 6,316 acres make it one of the largest historic districts in the nation. Pendleton is fortunate to have more than forty individually recognized historic structures and sites within its boundaries, most dating before 1865. It is a popular destination for tourists looking for authentic heritage attractions such as house museums, walking tours of the residential section, shopping for antiques, local hand-made craft items, the annual festival and other special events as well as enjoying a variety of popular restaurants, bakery and local Bed &amp; Breakfast lodging.",

        "Description_full": "Greenville County was Cherokee Territory before the Revolution. European settlers were forbidden to live here until 1777, when Native Americans were forced to cede this land to the new state. Most of modern day Greenville was hunting land used by the Cherokees, whose main villages were located in modern day Oconee County. A part of the Iroquoian nation, the Cherokees may have set up temporary summer camps along the banks of the reedy River. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Native American artifacts were found along the north bank of the river. McBee's Mills Vardry McBee purchased more than 11,000 acres around the reedy River from Lemual Alston in 1815. Although McBee lived in Lincolnton, North Carolina, he wished to develop his Greenville property, and in 1819 he built a brick corn mill on the south bank of the Reedy River. In 1829 he added a stone grist mill. The mills attracted farmers from miles around who brought their wheat and corn to be ground by miller Elias Alexander, McBee's brother-in-law, who lived in a cottage above the river. Both mills were dilapidated by the early twentieth century. The stone mill was dismantled to build the Gassaway Mansion in the mid 1920's. One wall of the brick mill remains and is visible from the spot you are now standing. Richard Pearis Richard Pearis, Greenville's first white settler, was an Irish adventurer who had settled in Virginia with his wife and family by the middle of the eighteenth century. He developed good trade relationships with the Cherokee, had a son by a Native American woman and in 1770 acquired the title to 100,000 acres of Cherokee land in what is now Greenville County. He set up his \"Great Plains\" Plantation with a trading post and grist mill on the banks of the Reedy River. Pearis was wooded by both Patriots and Tories when the American Revolution began. When he went with the British, Patriots burned his house, mill and store. He fled to the Bahamas and never returned to Greenville. Paris Mountain is named for him.",

The 118th Infantry Regiment had more medals of honor recipients than any other regiment during WWI. More than half of all British awards to Americans went to members of the Thirtieth. \"The Division accomplished every task assigned to it. Not a single failure is recorded against it. Not a scandal occurred to mar the glory of its achievements. Duty to God, to country, and to home, well done is the highest standard humanly attainable.

        "Description_full": "The old city wall remained buried and forgotten until traces of Granville Bastion were discovered at 40 East Bay Street in the 1920s. In the 1960s a portion of the Half Moon Battery was discovered in the basement of the Old Exchange Building. This is the only section of the wall on view to the public. Today, thanks to increased public awareness, underground wall &amp;#8220;sightings&amp;#8221; are reported regularly by road and utility crews and homeowners.The RedanA redan is a triangular fortification that projects out from the main fortification or curtain wall. Charles Town�s brick curtain wall had three redans: one at Tradd Street, one near North Atlantic Wharf, and one near Cone Street. The redans worked in concert with the corner bastions and the Half Moon Battery to protect the city from a naval assault. Five or six cannon were mounted behind a parapet on each redan. In 2008, when the City of Charleston temporarily removed cobblestones at South Adger�s Wharf, archaeologists seized the opportunity to look for the Tradd Street redan. A 1785 plat hinted that the structure was located here.Archaeology at South Adger�s WharfIn 2008 and 2009 archaeologists dug through 10 layers of soil representing 300 years of Charleston�s history here at South Adger�s Wharf. They found the Tradd Street redan in nearly perfect condition! The brick redan was five feet wide and eight feet tall. The wall was supported by cypress piles. The parapet, which had been pushed over and buried with the redan, would have added at least three more feet to the structure. Seven-foot pales were driven into the mud in front of the redan to form a palisade. The area between the palisade and the redan was filled with ballast stones, oyster shells, and brick fragments. This helped stop seawater from undermining the redan.The Mayor�s Walled City Task ForceThe Walled City Task Force was appointed by Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. in 2005 to study, identify, protect, and interpret the walled city of Charleston. The Task Force includes researchers, government representatives, and private citizens. It sponsors lecture programs and walking tours and coordinates archaeological and historical research to help locate and document evidence of the colonial walled city. Visit Historic Charleston Foundation for a walking tour brochure. See artifacts from the excavations at the Charleston Museum.",

A decade later the world's longest railroad was constructed, linking Hamburg to Charleston. Unfortunately, further railroad extensions in Edgefield County were delayed for many years, with the railroad not reaching the Town of Edgefield until 1888. The first textile manufacturing operation in the Edgefield District was started by another enterprising German immigrant, Christian Breithaupt, who built a mill in 1828 on Horse Creek at Vaucluse. In 1845 William Gregg chartered the Graniteville Company, which became the most noteworthy textile mill in the antebellum South. Daniel Augustus Tompkins, a remarkable engineer, businessman and industrial prophet, was an Edgefield son who had a great impact on the industrialization of the entire South. He was the father of the cotton seed oil industry, and also designed and built over 200 textile mills throughout the South, including the 1896 Edgefield mill. In the decades following World War II, a number of national companies built manufacturing plants in the county. Today, Edgefield County's economy is broadly diversified, with the agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors each providing approximately equal measures of economic activity.",

        "Description_full": "On April 7, 1863, the Union Navy sent its new force of ironclad warships - eight monitors and the frigate New Ironsides - to attack Fort Sumter. The ironclads attacked from the water directly in front of you.As the Union fleet approached, Confederate shots poured onto the ironclads. Pounded by Forts Moultrie and Sumter, and batteries on Morris Island and Sullivan's Island, the fleet retreated after two hours. Union commander Rear Admiral Samuel Du Pont decided not to renew the attack: \"We have met with a sad repulse. I shall not turn it into a great disaster.\" (Description of drawing on the bottom of marker):Union ironclad warships attack Fort Sumter (below), April 7, 1863. Admiral Du Pont directed the Union attack from the flagship New Ironsides (left), as Fort Moultrie (right) and Fort Johnson (left) fired in the distance. In the smoke and confusion, the unwieldy ironclads collided, turrets jammed, and signals from the flagship were ineffective.The ironclads fired only 154 rounds while Confederates fired more than 2,200 shots, severely damaging five vessels. Keokuk was hit ninety times and sank the following day. Confederates later recovered Keokuk's guns and mounted one at Fort Sumter.",

        "Name": "Irvin Pitts Park / Ware Shoals",
        "Description_full": "Irvin Pitts Park is a corridor of land sandwiched between the Saluda River and a canal, which conducts water from the dam to the hydroelectric powerhouse that supplied electricity for Riegel textile mills and the village of Ware Shoals for most of the twentieth century. In fact, the Saluda River was the natural resource that spawned the town of Ware Shoals.The dam, the mill and the town were born in the same year - 1902 - and the Ware Shoals Manufacturing Company (later renamed Riegel Textile Corporation) shaped the community and its citizens for more than 80 years until it closed in 1985. Birds All of the birds native to the upstate inhabit the area, including cranes, herons, ducks, geese, jays, crows, starlings, sparrows and various owls. Wild ducks are sometimes seen drifting with the current over the rapids; they seem to enjoy the experience as much as humans on inner tubes do. Trees Trees that are most commonly found in the park area and along the river are sycamores, several species of oak, sweet gums, persimmons, alders, and many river birches that typically are leaning languorously over the flowing waters. Creeper Virginia creeper, a harmless five leaflet vine, grows in the area. Wile grape vines dangle from the upper limbs of some trees. Stands of wild canes appear along the river below the park. Shoals The river flows for several hundred yards over water-sculptured granite outcrops or shoals, which, coupled with the name of the family that owned the land in the area, gave rise to the name of the community. Perhaps a hundred yards wide at points, the river can be crossed at low water by walking and jumping from one sinuously carved rock to another. The river is a deep as 15 to 30 feet at some points. Lizards Lizards seen by the watchful observer are the five-lined skink or bluetail (from the royal blue tail sported by the males), the gray fence swift, and the Carolina green anole, which is sometimes miscalled the Carolina chameleon. While the anole usually appears in its lime green coloration and is capable of changing to shades of gray or brown, it is not a true chameleon. Fish Many different types of fish have been caught in the river, which has been a popular fishing locale since residents traveled there in covered wagons 200 years ago. These include small-mouthed, large-mouthed, striped and white bass. There also are white perch, bream, blue gills, channel catfish and, rarely, pike. Since 1981, the town of Ware Shoals has held the Catfish Festival during the last weekend of May that draws thousands of visitors to its town square. There was one report of a 60-pound catfish being caught. Snakes There are several varieties of snakes, which inhabit the shoals' area/ Various water snakes inhabit the river, but none are venomous. The copperhead and highland moccasin is the only poisonous snake in the area, but it tries to avoid human contact if possible. Black rat snakes, coach whips, green snakes, and garter snakes are infrequently sighted but can be found by someone seeking them out. Mammals Mammals living alongside the river include whitetail deer, raccoon, gray fox, opossum, gray squirrel and flying squirrel. Turtles Many species of turtles such as the river cooters or soft shell are commonly seen sunning themselves stop the rocky shoals of the river. If you look closely you may also see snapping or monk \"Stink pot\" turtles in the water. Ware Shoals The Town and the River A favorite spot for taking in the beauty of the area picnicking, wading and fishing, the banks of the Saluda River have drawn folks from the surrounding countryside for more than 200 years. The name of the owner of the nearby gristmill, Nicholas Ware, was combined with the river's shoals to create the name of Ware's Shoals, later shortened to Ware Shoals. The town sprang to life because of its proximity to the Saluda River where Abbeville, Laurens and Greenwood Counties meet along South Carolina's Heritage Corridor. The Town's Origins The town of Ware Shoals and Ware Shoals Manufacturing Company (later renamed Riegel Textile Corporation) were born in the same year - 1902. Nat Dial of Laurens county started the river dam construction at the turn of the 20th Century as a means of powering his cotton plant. When Dial ran out of money, he turned to New Jersey businessman, Benjamin Riegel who bought the mill and completed the dam. At the same time, Riegel fathered a town. The Mill's Role in the Town The economic and social life of ware Shoals revolved around the mill for more than 80 years. Generations of Ware Shoals' families worked in the textile mill, and for many of them, this was the only job and way of life they would ever know. Once one of the largest textile manufacturing s of the southeastern United States, Riegel Textile Corporation employed 5,000 people at its peak in 1960. The mill closing in 1985 had a major impact on the town's 2,000 citizens and its economy. But Ware Shoals fought back and continued to prosper. The mill site has been the beneficiary of a $2,700,000 investment in cleanup efforts and redevelopment through the Brownfields Project. Ware Shoals was presented with the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 Rising Star Award. Riegel Stadium Riegel Stadium was built in 1931 utilizing laborers from President Roosevelt's nation-wide job program. The stadium is most renowned for baseball. Through the decades, Riegel Stadium has hosted high school teams, textile leagues, Negro leagues, American Legion ball and even the big leagues. A 1954 exhibition game here showcased the Cincinnati Red Legs and the Washington Senators. Memorial Fountain The Memorial Fountain in front of Katherine Hall was created in 1968 through the dedication of a number of local clubs to raise the needed funding and gifts donated as memorials to war veterans who worked at the mill. The \"Big Friendly\" Ware Shoals Town Hall is located in the former \"Big Friendly,\" as the Riegel Textile Corporation's company store was known. Started as a one-room shanty in 1906, the \"Big Friendly\" became one of the finest and most modern department stores in the state after its new location was completed in 1920. Its motto, \"You can buy in one store anything from a paper and pen to a Ford automobile, from a baby girl's rattle to her wedding dress\" reflected the extent of the store's role in the community. The store closed in 1963. Katherine Hall/The YMCA Dedicated as the \"Peoples' Amusement Hall,\" Katherine Hall was named for the Riegel's only child when it was built in 1913. Katherine Hall, the for the mill workers to relax, has housed a wide spectrum of community activities ranging from a movie theater to the Senior Citizens Center.",

White settlers followed these trails to explore the countryside, trade, and eventually, to settle. As the stream of settlers into the region increased, better roads were required to transport supplies safely and easily. The historic roadbed before you, the Island Ford Road, was an important travelers route from places east and north of Ninety Six. Years of heavy use and erosion caused the road's sunken appearance. A ferry was established at Island Ford, a shallow crossing of the Saluda River, as early as 1775. Travelers would cross there and take the Island Ford Road about 10 miles southwest directly to Ninety Six. Revolutionary War Loyalist and Patriot troops used this route to transport supplies to Ninety Six. Imagine how this road would have appeared to colonial inhabitants. Wagons and carts pulled by horses or ozen were piled high with sacks of flour, bolts of cloth, and kegs of gunpowder. They clattered by on the unpaved surface. The uneven road was probably mired in mind or swirling in dust, depending on the season. It was often perilous, as cart wheels could give way or become stuck, causing passengers to fall and valuable loads to spill.",

        "Description_full": "Prior to the fire of 1881, this was the site of the store and barroom of A.A. Clisby (1848-1916) where the infamous Booth-Toney Shootout of 1878 occurred. (See the that marker for further information.) The present building was built in 1891 by James M. Cobb (1849-1912), a longtime Edgefield merchant. Cobb had operated a dry goods business in Edgefield as early as 1870 and continued in business well into the 20th century. Prior to 1891 his business was located next door in The Corner Store. Israel Mukashy (1882-1964), a Jewish merchant who had emigrated from Russia in 1905, occupied this building for many years. Beginning about 1908, Mukashy worked as a peddler out of Augusta, traveling in a one-horse wagon through the Edgefield countryside selling his wares. In 1911, when he first opened his store in Edgefield, he was described as a \"successful merchant of Augusta.\" He was originally located on the north side of Main Street and then on Park Row, before moving to this location in 1920. He sold the business in 1950, but lived on in Edgefield with his wife, Mrs. Kate R. Marcus Mukashy (ob. 1984) until his death in 1964. Much beloved in Edgefield, Mr. and Mrs. Mukashy were affectionately known as \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Muk.\" In 1950 the Mukashy Department store, was sold to Mr. Joseph Vigodsky of Greenville and was operated under the name \"Carolina Sales.\" At that time it came under the management of Mr. Archie E. Keesley, Sr. (1926-2000). Mr. Keesley operated the store for nearly a half century until his retirement in 1999. His contributions to the Town of Edgefield during his lifetime were manifold.",

The following is a summary of Rev. Daniels' poem, which thrust Issaqueena in immortality. This beautiful waterfall is named for a Creek maiden called Issaqueena. There are many legends about Issaqueena. The most popular story tells how as a girl Issaqueena was captured by the Cherokee and given the name Cateechee. As a young woman she met and fell in love with a white trader named Allan Francis. One day she overheard a plan by the Cherokee to attack the settlements on the frontier. To warn her lover, she found a swift pony and rode 96 miles to his trading fort. As she traveled, Issaqueena named the landmarks she crossed on her way -- Six mile Mountain, twelve Mile River, Eighteen Mile Creek, and others on her way to her final destination at Fort Ninety-Six. Fearing retribution from the Cherokees, Issaqueena remained with Allan, eventually marrying him. In time, she, Allan, and their newborn baby moved back to Stumphouse Mountain where they built their home. One day, the Cherokee Chief, angered with the white settlers, sent his warriors to capture Issaqueena. Issaqueena saw them coming and ran toward the waterfall to escape capture. Knowing that the Cherokee believed evil spirits lived in waterfalls, she pretended to leap to her death. She hid on the ledge below the top of the waterfall where she remained until it was safe to rejoin her family. Her dramatic escape began the legend of Issaqueena Falls.",

        "Name": "Iva-A Small Railroad Town",
        "Description_full": "In 1886, the Savannah Valley railroad made its way into lower Anderson County. The depot town of Cook's Station was named for Dr. Augustus G. Cook, a local physician and businessman. The town was later called Iva in honor of Iva Cook Bryson, Dr. Cook's daughter. The settlement consisted of little more than a store, a grain mill or cotton gin, blacksmith shops, and a cottonseed oil mill. With the arrival of the railroad, the community went from a farming settlement, to a railroad community, and later became an industrial mill community when Jackson Mill was founded in 1906. In 1985, the Town of Iva officially became a \"Great Town\" in South Carolina marking the beginning of the restoration of Iva. Outdoor recreational activities are numerous given its proximity to Hartwell, Russell, Secession, and Thurmond Lakes. Located only miles from downtown Iva is the Thomason-Bowie Outdoor Educational Farm that is open to the public. Jackson Mill Jackson Mill, once considered one of the strongest cotton mills in the South, was built by Thomas C. Jackson. At its peak, the mill boasted approximately 1500 workers and was the largest employer in this part of the county. Although the mill closed in the 1990s, the building remains standing and evidence of the mill village can still be found today. Belton The town of Belton was chartered in 1855 as a \"child of the railroad.\" Today the revitalized town square invites shoppers and is also known as the \"Tennis Capital of South Carolina,\" host of the annual Palmetto Championship. Honea Path Much like Iva, Honea Path began as an agricultural community and later became a railroad town. Most prominent on the town's landscape is the Chiquola Mill and nearby mill village. Split Creek Dairy Goat Farm Located on a few miles from Iva is the Split Creek Dairy Goat Farm. In addition to its world famous and award winning cheeses and fudge, the farm offers goat milk, goat milk soap, and art produced by one of the owners.",

Behind it lies one of the largest Corps of Engineer lakes east of the Mississippi. The Thurmond Dam powerhouse contains seven power units, each capable of generating 40,000 kilowatts. Its average annual energy output is 920-million kilowatt hours. Since its completion, Thurmond Dam has prevented millions of dollars in flood damage to down stream sites, and had produced power revenues sufficient to repay its original construction cost in less than 25 years.",

He graduated from Clemson University with a degree in architecture with a goal of getting into planning while having a design background. After many years working in the private sector Jack became the Director of the City of Myrtle Beach in 1984. When the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base closed in 1993 Jack served on a number of committees and task forces dedicated to base redevelopment. He worked with Design Works, L.C. in creating an urban village master plan for the Market Common. The main impetus of the urban village was two-fold. First was the desire to diversify the Grand Strand economy by providing jobs and housing opportunities not associated with tourism. Second was the desire to take advantage of the existing base structure of buildings and infrastructure. Jack worked closely with the Myrtle Beach Air Base Redevelopment Authority to make the urban village master plan and other Market Common district projects a reality. Jack is very passionate about urban outdoor recreation spaces. He assisted with the design of the Grand Park that is heavily utilized by the community. He worked very hard to expand the Grand Park across Farrow Parkway to create the linear park before you today. The park can be enjoyed by bicyclists, walkers, people fishing, or just relaxing in the shade of a tree .Jack's dream was for the Market Common to be the perfect model of what the future of Myrtle Beach could look like - creative land use, public space, multi-use paths, roads and parks, all coming together with residential and retail opportunities. After 31 years of public service Jack retired from the city in 2015, and continues his visioning at his leisure.",

Side Two When the loud cries for help from Florida merged with the savage yell of the murderous Seminole, first reached our state, and Carolina�s sons promptly responded to the call, they stirred no nobler soul than thine, young gallant Dickinson. Soon after this campaign, he was admitted to the bar, at which he continued a practitioner until the United States became involved in war with Mexico, during which period he was for six years a member of the state legislature, and was honored with the highest military office of the district. Side Three When Volunteers for Mexico from every quarter of our state rallied to the country�s call showing that South Carolina was prepared in spirit and resources to stand shoulder to shoulder beside her sister states the heroic soul of Dickinson rose to a sublimity in action and eloquence which electrified the district How inspiring his words and manly bearing when addressing his regiment for the last time he seized the banner of his old company The DeKalb Rifle Guards, hastily unfurled its proud and glorious motto to the breeze and planting it firmly in front exclaimed &amp;#8220;Here soldiers is your standard you once pledged your sacred honor never to desert it.

The Lethe Agricultural Seminary was founded here after De La Howe's death in 1797. Initially restricted John De La Howe School to 24 boys and girls from what was then Abbeville County, with preference given to orphans, the school emphasized manual training, or instruction in operating a self-sufficient farm. In 1918 it was turned over to the State of South Carolina, opened to children from every county in the state, and renamed John De La Howe School; it is now a group child care agency serving over 200 students a year.",

The purpose of Dr. de la Howe's gift was to help dependent and neglected children, Founded in 1797 at the passing of the Dr. John de la Howe, an emigre from either \"the north of France, or Holland, or perhaps Flanders,\" the John de la Howe School still stands as a place where children from throughout the state of South Carolina come to learn basic life skills and behaviors. Origins of the School Dr. de la Howe's concept came from an article in the April 1787 Columbia Magazine. In his will, Dr. de la Howe bequeaths his real and personal estate to the President and Agriculture Society of South Carolina in trust for the purpose of having the school established as proposed in this article. The benefactors of the school would be twelve boys and twelve girls whose parents or who themselves have resided in Abbeville County (now McCormick County). The Establishment of the Industrial School In 1918, the General Assembly, upon the recommendation of the Board of Trustees, converted Lethe into a new state agency accountable to the legislature. Shortly thereafter the school's name was changed to John de la Howe Industrial School. Even at this point the old manual labor idea was still the guiding principle, and the mission and spirit continues to inspire those who work here. The dreams of John de la Howe, and many others over the generations continued into the 21st century. John de la Howe's Life De la Howe's dream began, many years prior to his death. He immigrated to Charleston in the spring of 1764. In 1768 he received a grant of 400 acres near the Long Cane Settlement, and in the late summer of 1774, he established residence at Lethe Farm in Long Cane. Between 1774 and 1785 he continued to acquire land in the same area. In the late summer of 1785, Dr. de la Howe returned to Lethe Farm. De. de la Howe died in 1797 and is buried according to specific directions in his will. His tomb is near the original site of the school.",

A brick house was initially built on the property that survived the fire of 1740 but was lost in the Great Fire of 1778. The present house, built circa 1784, was owned by John McCall (1741-1800), a Revolutionary War captain who commanded the Grenadier Company of the Charles Town Regiment. After the war he worked as an insurance broker and was City Treasurer. He was also a member of the South Carolina Society, which his father helped found. During his ownership the boundaries of the property were expanded to include the lot known today as 64 Church Street. The property remained in the McCall family for almost a hundred years. The house is a traditional three and a half story Charleston single home. The frame structure rests on a raised brick basement and is crowned by s hipped roof with projecting dormers. The structure is dominated by gracious piazzas that at one time were enclosed to create apartments. A renovation completed in 2007 reversed this enclosure returning the house to its original form. Over the years, the house has been both a residence and a commercial space. It was home to a medical steam bath, a team room, an art studio, an antique shop, and a rare book store.",

        "Description_full": "Born in Luzerne County Pennsylvania - Son of Runaway Slaves - Grew up in Springfield, Pennsylvania and was privately tutored and mentored by a Presbyterian minister who was active in the anti-slavery movement. Educated in Common Schools of Pennsylvania and Lancasterian Academy, Ithaca, N.Y. Read Law in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for years in local law office and the office of a judge, and was later admitted to the practice of law in August of 1866, making him the first black attorney in Pennsylvania. Came to Beaufort, S.C. in 1865, hired by the American Missionary Association to teach black Federal troops, and later was a legal advisor for Freedman's Bureau. Wright viewed this responsibility as one to \"vindicate the cause of the downtrodden\", and as such, quickly acquired a following among the newly freed slaves. He was a delegate to the Colored People's Convention at Zion Church in Charleston, and was elected to the Union Republican Party's State Central Committee, and a delegate to the South Carolina State Constitutional Convention in 1867. As a passionate advocate for public education and consensus among peoples of different backgrounds, he was primarily responsible for the Convention creating the State's Public School System. (Right panel) At Liberty Hall in Charleston, Wright urged his fellow citizens to judge others not by their race or political affiliation, but by \"their moral and intrinsic value their honesty and integrity and their love of liberty\". Elected to the S.C. Senate in April 1868 Elected to the S.C. Supreme Court as Associate Justice on February 1, 1870, and served until December 1,1877, where he authored some 90 decisions that influenced the direction of the Court. Many of these decisions are still relied upon to this day as legal precedents. Wright's resignation in 1877 from the Court came about after he refused to recognize the disputed election of Wade Hampton as Governor, which he said he could not do and \"honor my judicial trust.\" Wright set up law offices at 84 Queen Street in Charleston, and began training law students officially registered at the Law Department of Claflin College. Wright died on February 19, 1895 after a long battle with tuberculosis, and was buried in Calvary Episcopal Church Cemetery on February 21, 1885, just one block from his residence at 69 Line Street. In February, 1998, the South Carolina Supreme Court hung a portrait of Wright in the lobby of the Supreme Court Building in honor of his distinguished service to the Court and the citizens of South Carolina. This plaque is erected in the memory of Justice Jonathan Jasper Wright with the sincere hope that his dream that \"we shall know no North, no East, no South, no West, no white nor colored, no Democrat nor Republican, but choose men because of their intrinsic value and their honestly and integrity\", will someday be a reality in America.",

By 1908, he was playing with the Greenville Spinners of the Class D Carolina League. During the first game of a doubleheader, Jackson played in new spikes that caused his feet to blister. In the 2nd game, with the Spinners at bat in the seventh inning, Jackson took off his spikes and walked to the batter's box. No one noticed he had discarded his shoes until he cracked a hit. As Jackson rounded the bases in his stocking feet, a fan of the opposing team shouted, \"You shoeless son-of-a-gun!\" A local sportswriter heard the remark and tagged Jackson with the nickname \"Shoeless Joe\". At the peak of his career with the Chicago White Sox, Jackson and seven of his teammates were implicated in a conspiracy to lose the 1919 World series. During the Series, Jackson played flawless baseball. He had twelve hits (a World Series record); no errors; the highest batting average (.375); accounted for eleven of twenty runs by the Sox; and hit the only home run in the Series. Though tried and found innocent, all eight players were banned from baseball for life. Until Jackson's death in 1951, he steadfastly maintained his innocence. He continues to be one of the most publicized and beloved baseball players in the history of the game.",

The Kaminskis furnished their home with antiques collected by Harold Kaminski's mother, Rose Baum Kaminski. When Julia Kaminski died in 1972, she bequeathed the grounds, house, and its contents to the city of Georgetown with the hopes of it being established as a historic house museum. The museum is dedicated to the memory of her husband and his mother reflecting a unique insight into the construction and furnishings of a bygone period.",

Sensing the British would move against him, Col. Marion sent one of his trusted officers, Maj. John James of the Williamsburg Militia, and a few men back to Kingstree to gather intelligence.While Patriot lore has called this incident the &amp;#8220;Battle of Kingstree,&amp;#8221; the reality was probably much more modest. Hiding behind a thicket on the side of a road (probably near here on what would become Academy Street), Maj. James and his men watched as dozens of troops rode into town. They conducted a brief hit-and-run strike, capturing at least one prisoner and an orderly book. From these, Marion learned that two hundred soldiers of the 63rd Regiment under Maj. James Wemyss had already reached Kingstree, and that hundreds more British and Loyalist troops were on their way. Other scouts confirmed that Marion�s force would soon be surrounded.Marion knew that leading some 150 militiamen against a force as much as ten times larger would be a suicide mission, and a disastrous defeat would break the morale of the rebellion in South Carolina. Faced with a simple strategic choice, Marion retreated into the Great White Marsh of eastern North Carolina and waited for the right moment to return and fight.",

        "Description_full": "At its largest, Lake Conestee's water surface covered about 130 acres - the area inside the colored boundaries shown on the four aerial photos. This original lake was created when the current dam at the mill was constructed about 1892. As the City of Greenville grew upstream, sediment from development and industrial discharge gradually began to fill the lake. During World War II, the construction of Donaldson Air Force Base, to the west on Marrow Bone Creek, increased the rate at which the lake was filled by sediment. In the 1950s, construction of I-85 to the north further accelerated the rate of sedimentation. Before 1943, sedimentation occurred mainly where the Reedy River and Marrow Bone Creek entered the lake. Where you now stand (indicated by *) was in the middle of an hourglass shaped lake. By 1955, sedimentation filled up much of the northern half of the lake, and the spot where you are now was just to the west of the banks of the reedy River as it re-emerged from the lake. In 1970, the main channel of the Reedy still passed just to the east of this spot, but a new channel had already begun to emerge much further to the east against the hills. Sometime between 1970 and the late 1980s, the course of the Reedy River completely shifted to its present location, over 500 feet east of this spot. Virtually the entire northern part of the lake and much of the southern part of the lake became land. As shown in the 2006 aerial photograph, since the 1980s much of the southern half of the lake has been filled with sediment, which has now migrated all the way to the dam. Eventually the remaining portions of the open lake may be filled in with sediment. All the trees behind you have grown since 1955 as the land emerged from the lake. As indicated by the large dead trees in the wetland in front of you, this area also was once dry land. However, as beavers began constructing their dam, the land became a wetland and the trees died, providing a new habitat for a diversity of wildlife.",

        "Description_full": "Andrew Carnegie was born in Scotland in 1835 as the Industrial Revolution was sweeping across Great Britian. Seeking a better life his family arrived in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania while Andrew was a small child. From a bobbin boy in a cotton mill Carnegie rose to steel magnate becoming one of the richest men in the world.[ Picture included] Following the sale of his steel company to rival JP Morgan, Carnegie, not believing in charity, set up the Carnegie Corporation to help those who wanted to help themselves. He stated that \" the man who dies rich dies disgraced.\" During the remainder of his life he gave away in excess of $350 million for the creation of over 2,500 libraries and for higher learning. Latta was one of thirteen communities in South Carolina to receive funds from the Carnegie Corporation for new libraries which were built between 1905 and 1920. The Latta Public Library opened in 1914 and is only one of five remaining in the state still in operation as a public library. The movement to create the library in Latta began in 1911 and was led by WC Allen a local businessman. Once the conditions for the Carnegie Corporation funding were met the town received $5,000 for the building and CF Bass donated the land. The building was later expanded with a rear addition and wing on the north to meet the growing needs of the community. Dillon County completed extensive renovations of the Library in 2005. Friends of the Latta Library provide financial assistance for ongoing support.",

By the 1880s, through mergers and new investments, the \"Golden Era of Railroads\" emerged in the country and literally rolled into the Pee Dee. A section of new rails that would become the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad entered this area in 1888. At this strategic point along the railroad a depot was constructed. The nucleus of a community was planted and it grew as new inhabitants arrived, started their businesses and built their homes creating the town of Latta. [Map included]: Section of Latta Branch, 1915 The town received its name from Robert J. Latta, a York, SC native, who was the railroad surveyor that laid out plans for the station. The first passenger and freight depots were constructed in 1888. That year a post office was authorized and in 1890 the town was incorporated. [Picture included]: Postcard depicts 20th Century Latta ACL Passenger depot What became known as the \"Latta Branch connected Latta with McColl in 1895 and passed through the towns of Mallory, Bingham, Blenheim, Dunbar and Clio. The increase in commercial activity led the following year to the construction of a new tobacco warehouse. By 1903 there were three tobacco warehouses and until the markets later shifted to Dillon and Mullins, Latta was the of tobacco marketing and the largest in the state.

Savannah National Wildlife Refuge includes portions of 13 former rice plantations. Ten including Laurel Hill, were located in South Carolina. Laurel Hill was nearly 400 acres in size and belongs to several owners during the years of rice cultivation in the Savannah area (1750-1860). The most prominent owner was Daniel Heyward (1810-1888). He was a nephew of Thomas Heyward Jr., a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and of Nathaniel Heyward, the greatest rice planter of his day, who once owned 10 South Carolina plantations and 2,000 slaves. Laurel Hill is bordered by the Little Back River, which is a channel of the Savannah River. Rice was grown in fields that were flooded with fresh water from the river. In, 1825, the plantation had a house, rice mill, winnowing house, barns, and dwellings for 150 slaves. Facing three life oaks on this knoll, the two-story clapboard house probably was home for the plantation overseers. A rice mill operated by tidal power was once located on Little Back River. It was replaced by a steam-powered facility built near this location. (caption) The Laurel Hill steam-powered mill operated from 1833 until 1880. Later the mill was converted into a tavern, rumored to have been a hotbed of drunken and disorderly activity. The infamous &amp;#8232;Rice Mill Tavern was abandoned by 1934, when the Laurel Hill tract was added to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge.",

Laurens was a Charleston merchant and the brother of Henry Laurens, President of the Continental Congress from 1777-1778. Edward Rutledge (1749-1800) purchased the property in 1788. Rutledge, a prominent Charleston lawyer, was a representative from South Carolina to the First and Second Continental Congress, 1774 - 1775 and was the youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence. Rutledge was elected Governor of South Carolina in 1798 and died in office in 1800. Originally a two-story Georgian double house, the residence has undergone much change since its construction in 1760. Remaining original elements of the house include the steep pitch roof and a five bay main block with a projecting pediment. The original rear kitchen building also survives. The Greek Revival piazzas on the east and west ends are early 19th century additions. In 1885 the property was acquired by Captain Frederick W. Wagener, owner of Charleston�s largest grocery wholesale company, F. W. Wagener &amp; Company. Wagener added a wing on the east end, made design changes in the front entrance, and created a Victorian foyer with curved staircase. Dr. Josiah Smith bought the house in 1935 and changed the exterior to its present Colonial Revival style.",

        "Description_full": "The Ninety Six jail stood on this site and the courthouse was about 100 yards from it, near the Charleston Road. After the Revolutionary War, the jail fell into disrepair and its bricks were reused for other purposes. But from 1772, when it was completed, through the siege of 1781, the jail and nearby courthouse elevated this frontier town's status from a remote wilderness outpost to a place of law, order, and civilization. Unlike colonial South Carolina's coastal communities, the early backcountry settlements were sparsely populated and had virtually no law enforcement. with the courts far away in Charleston, a vigilante group called Regulators emerged. Ninety Six was the for the Regulator movement. By 1767 there were about 4,000 Regulators, whose self-appointed duties including tracking down bandits, punishing immoral women, and expelling vagrants. The Regulator movement was replaced by a circuit court system in 1769, and by the time the courthouse was built a judge from Charleston came twice a year -- in April and November -- to hear cases and impose sentences. The buildings were also an important part of the town's defences during the Revolutionary War. David Fanning, a Loyalists captured by Patriots, manage four impressive escapes from the Ninety Six jail, and described his last incarceration: \"I was chained and ironed as before, in the centre of a room, 30 feet square; forty-five from the ground, the snow beating in through the roof, with 4 grates open night and day. I remained in this state eleven days. I got my chains off in the night for the 12th.\" Once unshackled, Fanning loosened an iron bar from a window, pried a plank from the floor, and made his break from the lower level.",

Unrelenting civil war had scourged the South with partisan plundering, bushwhacking, and brutal massacres-neighbor against rancorous neighbor, and fathers against sons.For the first time since Lexington and Concord, people living in the nearby Piedmont and over-mountain settlements had to make a hard choice. The men who charged through these woods were determined to defend their homes. They had taken up arms against the King and his officers, and now they would spill blood-for a new country.Patriot fighters here wore their everyday frontier clothes, not military uniforms. Some Whigs put scraps of white paper in their hats, the only way to distinguish a friend from a Tory foe.Militiamen answered the call to duty armed with an assortment of weapons from their farms and hunting camps-long rifles, hunting knives, muskets, and tomahawks.",

        "Description_full": " Over three weeks in March 1781, Brig. Gen. Francis Marion conducted a series of engagements between the Santee River and Georgetown, battering a larger force of British regulars and Loyalist militiamen under the command of Col. John Watson. This series of skirmishes is known as Watson�s Chase or the Bridges Campaign.After clashes at Wiboo Swamp and Mount Hope Swamp, Marion continued moving east along the Santee towards Murray�s Ferry, thinking Watson would follow. But Watson turned north and made for the Lower Bridge over the Black River, with Kingstree just beyond. Marion and his men moved quickly to get to the Lower Bridge first. When Watson arrived at the high bluffs of the south bank (across the river), he found the bridge partially destroyed and Marion�s men arrayed against him on the low, swampy ground of the north bank (on this side of the river). In most battles, the high ground is the best tactical position. But in this case, when Watson sent his artillery forward, the artillerymen could not lower their guns far enough to hit their opponents below. As Marion�s expert riflemen picked off his artillerymen, Watson withdrew to the Witherspoon plantation nearby. Baffled at the defeat, Watson reportedly said to his unwilling Whig hostess: &amp;#8220;I have never seen such shooting before in my life.&amp;#8221;",

Lt Col Clarke accumulated several hundred flying hours in United States Air Force aircraft, most notably the F-100 Super Sabre and the A-7D Corsair II. He joined the 354th Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in May 1971 and deployed with the Wing to Southeast Asia operating from Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in support of the war in Vietnam. While there he flew as an A-7D Sandy pilot whose mission was to support the rescue and recovery of downed pilots. On one such mission over North Vietnam on 18 November 1972, he directed the successful rescue and recovery of two downed pilots. The President of the United States awarded the Air Force Cross to Maj Colin A. Clarke for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force as On-Scene Commander for search and rescue operations over North Vietnam on 18 November 1972. On that date, Maj Clarke directed an extremely complex mission that resulted in the successful recovery of two downed airmen despite adverse weather, mountainous terrain, and intense hostile ground fire. Disregarding these hazards, his own safety, and battle damage to his aircraft, he personally guided the rescue helicopter to the survivor's location, suppressed hostile defenses, and continued to direct rescue efforts even though he sustained additional damage to his aircraft. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, Maj Clarke reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

        "Name": "Lucas' 1792 Wind Powered Sawmill",
        "Description_full": "The Sawmill at Cape Romain�s Mill IslandIn the late 1780�s John Bowman of Peachtree Plantation hired the now famous millwright, Johnathan Lucas, to build a second less publicized mill, the wind~driven sawmill on Cape Romain�s Mill Island. William Lucas, the son of the mills builder, was born at the windmill site in 1789. The project was completed in 1792. Trees from the plantations of the Santee region were rafted together and floated downstream to Mill Island where they were cut into boards that were used in construction projects.The mill might have resembled a Dutch ~ style windmill with a small wooden superstructure sitting on top of a tower made of brick. The blades or sails were once attached to this sixteen - foot iron shaft and were driven by the strong winds coming off the ocean. The shaft was in a horizontal position (at a slight angle) at the top of the tower. A large wooden gear located at the transferred the power to another gear and vertical shaft that carried the power to a second horizontal shaft that operated several reciprocating saw blades.In the late 1820�s the abandoned mill, now without blades, was being mistaken for the nearby lighthouse and was considered a threat to navigation. A wooden cross was placed on it�s top so that it would not be confused with the light tower. It survived the Civil War, but later collapsed or was demolished.(Back):What the Cotton Planter Owes to Eli Whitney, the Rice Planter Owes to Jonathan Lucas.Jonathan Lucas, invention genius of the rice industry, was from Cumberland County, England. To this man�s skill and genius, South Carolina owes a great debt of gratitude..While traveling, Jonathan Lucas was shipwrecked off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. He settled there soon after in 1783. His talents as a millwright were discovered in a most curious way. While walking on King Street, John Bowman of Peachtree Plantation on the Santee River, noticed a small wind mill perched on the gable end of a store. Bowman, who was interested in wind power, entered the store and inquired as to hwo was the maker. He was told that he was Lucas, then a resident in the house, a man in need of work. A meeting was held and the machinist returned to the Santee with Bowman who quietly pointed out the difficulties under which the rice planter labored. The result was the first successful water powered Rice Pounding Mill. This mill and the ones Jonathan Lucas developed in later years would change the entire economy of South Carolina and make wealthy men of the Carolina Rice Planter. The Rice Pounding Mill at Wambaw Plantation The property on which the mill was built was one of four plantations once owned by Daniel Horry II including adjoining Hampton Plantation. Since Mr. Horry died in 1785, his widow Harriett Pinckney Horry, (daughter of indigo�s famous developer Eliza Lucas Pinckney) apparently ordered the mill built in 1792 by Jonathan Lucas.William Lucas, son of the mill�s builder, purchased Wambaw Plantation in 1832. The part of the plantation on which the mill was built and where it�s ruins still stand remains in the possession of the descendants of Jonathan Lucas.The foundation timbers and a considerable amount of brick remain near the mouth of Cedar Creek, as well as the end of the earthen dam which formed the reservoir. One of the large wheel hubs, an iron bar, the wallower gear, and the concave cast iron bottom from one of the huge mortars are in this exhibit",

The business was founded by William Edward Lynch (1851-1896), and continued by his wife, Kate Holstein Lynch (1854-1923), and son, W. Charlton Lynch (1882-1924) for nearly a century. William Edward Lynch had started his business career in partnership with A.A. Clisby as early as 1872, but went out on his own in 1877. His store, like many drug stores of that age, sold groceries as well. The Lynch building was burned in the fire of 1881, but was rebuilt as two stores immediately thereafter. It again burned n the fire of 1884, and was again rebuilt. After Dr. W.E. Lynch's death in 1896, Mrs. Lynch continued the business until her son, Dr. William Charlton Lynch, a graduate of the University of Maryland pharmacy school, was able to return and take over the business early in the 20th century. In 1920 the store again burned. Following the fire, the Lynch family built the metal building which now houses the Old Edgefield Pottery as temporary quarters until they could rebuild the building. At the same time they sold half of their frontage on the square to the People's Bank which built the adjoining building. Dr. Lynch continued to operate W.E. Lynch &amp; Co. until his eighty-seventh year when he retired. In 1974, following Dr. Lynch's death, the building was purchased by Maurice \"Bully\" Rubenstein (1910-1992) who moved his family's dry goods business here. In 1987, the building was purchased by the Edgefield Civic League under the leadership of Mrs. Nancy Crocket Mims, and has been used to house the expansion of the Tompkins Library from the adjoining building.",

        "Name": "Lynching of Anthony Crawford / Racial Violence in South Carolina",
        "Description_full": "The Lynching of Anthony Crawford In Abbeville on Saturday, October 21, 1916, a white mob lynched a black leader named Anthony Crawford for cursing a white man. A 56-year-old planter, \"Grandpa\" Crawford owned 427 acres of land, had 13 children, and helped establish a school, a church, and farms in the local black community. During the Jim Crow era, successful black people were conspicuous - and arguing with whites was dangerous. That day, a white merchant demanded to buy Mr. Crawford's cottonseed for a lower price. Mr. Crawford, who used to tell his family he'd rather \"throw the seed in the Penny Creek,\" refused to sell. After an argument, Mr. Crawford was arrested. A few hours later, 300 white men seized him from jail and dragged him through town behind a buggy. Finally stopping at the fairgrounds, the mob stabbed, beat, hanged, and shot Mr. Crawford over 200 times - then forbade the Crawford family to remove his hanging body from the tree. Terrorized, the well-established, multi-generational Crawford family and many other local black people realized that Abbeville was not safe for them. Amid continued threats, most of the family scattered North, leaving behind what their patriarch had built, and carrying the painful loss of his wisdom and humor. A century later, this maker symbolizes their continued remembrance - and hope that Abbeville never forget or repeat that horrendous October day. Racial Violence in South Carolina Before the Civil War, South Carolina relied on a plantation economy and enslaved Africans outnumbered white residents. Dehumanized, brutalized, and treated as property, black people resisted in ways small and large to survive. After the Confederacy's defeat, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution ended slavery and guaranteed black citizenship rights. Reconstruction promised federal enforcement and gave African Americans hope for the future. Black men used their new voting rights and, in South Carolina, elected African-American candidates to all levels of government. African Americans' political and economic advancement soon sparked resentment and violence. When federal protection ended in 1877, lynching - or murder at the hands of a mob - became a tool for re-establishing white supremacy and terrorizing the black community. White mobs lynched more than 4000 black people in the south between 1877 and 1950, and more than 180 of them were killed in South Carolina. In addition to Anthony Crawford in 1916, at least seven other men were lynched in Abbeville County during the era: Dave Roberts (1882); James Mason (1894); Thomas Watts and John Richards (1895); Allen Pendleton (1905); Will Lozier (1915); and Mark Smith (1919).",

He returned to America with the Marquis de Lafayette in 1777 to assist the American revolutionaries, and Congress appointed him a major general in the Continental Army. Having led the Maryland and Delaware Continental troops to the South in 1780, he fought heroically at the Battle of Camden, where he received 11 gunshot and bayonet wounds. He was treated at the British military hospital at Camden by Lord Cornwallis�s own surgeons, and reportedly told a British officer: &amp;#8220;I die the death I always prayed for: the death of a soldier fighting for the rights of man.&amp;#8221; He died on August 19 and was buried at this location with full military honors. Disinterred in 1825, his body was reburied at Bethesda Presbyterian Church on DeKalb Street. &amp;#8220;Too much honor cannot be paid by Congress, to the memory of the Baron De Kalb. He was every thing an excellent officer should be, and in the cause of the United States, he has sacrificed his life.&amp;#8221; Gen. Horatio Gates",

The managed wetlands benefit fish, shorebirds, wading birds, and waterfowl &amp;#8211; including nearly 25,000 ducks annually. Aquatic management keeps wetlands flooded for several years to encourage plants with high food value and cover for wildlife. Aquatic impoundments also provide breeding habitat for birds, amphibians and fish. These animals, in turn are prey for alligators, river otter, ospreys, and bald eagles. Moist soil management produces shallow water and mudflat habitats. Water is drained during the growing season to promote plants preferred by wintering waterfowl, breeding birds, and other wildlife. Countless invertebrates that thrive within decaying plant litter provide valuable sources of protein for migrating shorebirds and ducks.",

        "Name": "Manly Portable Convict Cage",
        "Description_full": "The Convict Cage, or \"Jail on Wheels,\" was actually a prison pulled by a team of horses or mules. During the early 20th century, it was not possible to return prisoners doing work in the remote areas of Pickens County back (here) to the Pickens \"Gaol\" every night. Although the wagon-cage is only twelve feet long, seven feet wide, and eight feet high, there were six metal bunk beds of three tiers each inside for a total of eighteen beds. A small metal barrel in the of the floor was used for a fire on cold nights, and canvas covered the sides of the cage to protect the men from cold winds. While the treatment of prisoners seems horrible by today's standards, it was hardly unusual for the early 1900s, and it was certainly far better than the treatment many prisoners received in the years before 1900. The People's Journal reported in the issue of March 19, 1903: \"As the Pickens County, S.C., portable caravansary, made for the county chain-gang, passed through Pickens on Saturday the earth trembled. It might prove a solution of the road problem, if enough mules could be attached to it to draw it over the county. It is a road picker.\" The men who worked on the roads in the county and who slept in the cage at night were often serving short sentences. On weekends, their families sometimes visited them and brought small baskets of food from home. One man, who remembers visiting a relative assigned to the cage while performing county work, remarked that everyone including the guards would have lunch together on Sunday and talk about friends and local happenings. A typical \"road meal\" consisted of foods such as fried bacon, biscuits and syrup, and coffee for breakfast; cabbage, bacon, and cornbread for lunch; and fried bacon, biscuits and syrup for supper. After the county acquired gasoline powered trucks and machinery in the 1930s the cage ceased to be used.",

        "Name": "Max Heller Legacy Plaza",
        "Description_full": "It was 1919 and Greenville, South Carolina had emerged from World War I with a surge of patriotism and community spirit. Main Street was a of activity and a building boom brought the Woodside Building, the Chamber of Commerce Building and the Poinsett Hotel to the downtown. The textile mills that circled the city were operating at full speed. It was an exciting time. [Middle Panel]: In Vienna, Austria, on May 28, 1919, Max Heller was born to Israel and Leah Heller. In the photo, Max's sister Paula is on the left, his mother Leah in the and Max on the right. Max grew up with a firm family foundation and a strong work ethic which carried him forward with vision and insight. [Bottom Panel]: After graduating from high school, he went to work in the wholesale business and was soon promoted to foreman and then buyer. This determination and strength of character would lead him to become, in later life, one of the driving forces in the revitalization of Greenville, South Carolina. The Threat of War [Top Panel 1]: In 1938 Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss of annexation of Austria and Nazi Germany. The stories of persecution, imprisonment and murder became very real for the Jewish community. Jewish stores were plundered, businesses confiscated and Jews in Vienna began to fear for their lives. Israel Heller lost his business and Max lost his job. [Top Panel 2]: \"We couldn't accept the stories that people were being persecuted and killed just because they were Jews.\" -- Max Heller [Bottom Panel 1]: A year earlier, Max had gone out dancing and met Mary Mills and her four young friends from Greenville, South Carolina who were on a European tour. Mary gave Max her address in Greenville. [Bottom Panel 2]: Events overseas and the threat of American involvement in a second world war were having an effect on everyone in Greenville. Increasing efforts were made to support the allies in Europe and aggressive preparations began for the defense of American soil. Escape to America [Top Panel 1]: Tensions mounted in Austria. Swastikas adorned every building, every uniform, and every flag. Grocery stores were plundered; Jewish-owned buildings were burned. Park benches core signs saying \"No Jews Allowed\". It was time for Max Heller and his family to leave the country. [Top Panel 2]: Max wrote to his friend Mary Mills asking her if she could arrange for a sponsor in Greenville. She contacted Shepard Saltzman, owner of Piedmont Shirt Factory, who agreed to sponsor Max and his sister Paula. [Bottom Panel 1]: Soon Max and Paula were on their way to Paris and then to America on the Ile de France. After a short visit in Newark with his mother's sister, Max headed to Greenville. [Bottom Panel 2]: Greenville was continuing to gear up for support of the war in Europe. Orders flooded into local textile mills and soon they were operating eighty hours a week. Relief packages and money were collected by the local Red Cross and sent to the allies in Britain and France. Volunteers were enlisted to make bandages and garments to be sent overseas. Land of Opportunity [Top Panel]: When Max's train arrived in Greenville, he was met at the train station by Shepard Saltzman, Mary Mills and several of her companions from the Vienna trip and Rabbi Mazure. Max only had $1.60 in his pocket. [Bottom Panel 1]: Mr. Saltzman invited Max to lunch but Max insisted on paying...five cents for a cup of soup. Before the day was out Max was at work at Piedmont Shirt Factory and a new career had begun. [Bottom Panel 2]: A greater step toward involvement in World War II for Greenville County residents came when Congress passed the first peacetime draft in American history on September 16, 1940. Not waiting for the draft, hundreds volunteered for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The War Department selected Greenville, SC as the site for a new Army airfield to support the buildup for the War. In June 1942 the Greenville Army Base was officially activated as a twin-engine bomber training base for replacement aircrews, being assigned to the III Bomber Command of Third Air Force. A Love Story [Top and Middle Panel]: When Max Heller was 18, he met a young girl named Trude Schonthal at a summer resort and fell in live with her. He told her that summer that someday they would be married. When Austria fell to Nazi Germany, Trude's family tried to get visas to the United States but no more were available. Her father escaped to Belgium and after hiding in the woods for five weeks, Trude and her mother finally crossed into Belgium. Trude and her mother eventually sailed to New York and later were joined by her father. In the summer of 1941 Max went to New York to visit Trude for the first time since they parted in Vienna. [Bottom Panel]: Mr. Saltzman, Max's employer, later brought Max's family over to the United States and Trude's family moved down to Greenville. The two families were united and Max and Trude were married in August of 1942. Mr. Saltzman gave both fathers jobs in his shirt factory. The Threat of War [Top Two Panels]: During World War II rationing and air raid drills became a way of life in Greenville. Community drives for relied, the purchase of war bonds and the collection of scrap metal became routine in wartime Greenville. textile mills, local utilities and the municipal airport employed extra security guards to prevent sabotage. The Nineteenth Army Air Force Glider Pilot Training Detachment was headquartered at Furman University and received flight training at the municipal airport. Max Heller began working in the Piedmont Shirt Factory sweeping floors and carrying shirt boxes. He worked 70 to 80 hours a week and there was no overtime pay. His first paycheck was for $10 with a dime taken out for Social Security. [Bottom Two Panels]: One day a co-worker told him to report to the front office because a judge wanted to see him. Max was terrified because he thought they were going to send him back to Austria. The man who greeted him was Judge John Plyler, the new president of Furman University, and he offered to help Max improve his English. When the foreman of the shipping department left the company, Max asked for the job and got it. Soon he was made internal sales manager, and by the time he was 26 he was General Manager of the company. The Entrepreneur [Top Panel]: By 1945 Max had become vice president of Piedmont Shirt Company. The company had offices in the Empire State Building in New york and opened a new plant in Walterboro, SC to make Wing shirts. [Middle Panel]: Max had promised Shepard Saltzman that he would never leave his employ unless he established his own company. However, in 1945, not content to work in someone else's business forever, he started the Williamston Shirt Company with two partners. The partnership was short-lived and in 1948 he sold his share and opened the Maxon Shirt Company in Greenville with sixteen employees. The business prospered under his energetic leadership and by 1962, the company had 700 employees. [Bottom Panel]: By this time the Hellers had three children -- Francie, Susan and Steven. They were active members of Congregation Beth Israel, where Max served as president of the synagogue. At the end of the War, Max and Trudie searched for displaced members of their families in Europe but located only two cousins. All of the others had died at the hands of the Nazis. Giving Back [Top Panel]: Greenville emerged from World War II as a prosperous, growing community. The textile industry was flourishing. The Memorial Auditorium was built downtown in 1959 and a new Textile Hall opened on the newly completed US 29 Bypass in 1964. [Middle and Bottom Two Panels]: The opening of the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport and Greenville Technical College in 1962 added valuable resources to the area. \"I was never interested in being the richest man in the cemetery.\" -- Max Heller Max decided that he wanted to devote his time to community service, so he sold his business in 1962 but by contract remained with the company for five more years, retiring officially in 1968. One of the community projects of which Max is so proud involves a citizens' group concerned about youthful offenders. Their work resulted in a law being passed in the legislature establishing a youthful offender's camp in Greenville County. Max has always been proud of this accomplishment. The Mayor's Vision [Top Two Panels]: Max Heller was elected to the Greenville City Council in 1968, where he focused his attention on improving substandard housing and making housing affordable for all. In 1971, he was elected mayor of Greenville. From the beginning his vision was to bring people together and to create a city government for everyone. He desegregated all departments and commissions in city government and, working with the Police chief Harold Jennings, made [sure] certain police department practices were color-blind. The people of Greenville embraced Max's vision and the city was integrated in a peaceful fashion. [Middle Panel]: Greenville's first African American to serve on City Council was elected in 1977. The photo on the left shows the Council from 1977 to 1979. Back row, from left to right, Thomas C. Gower, Rev. Rayfield Medcalf, Harry B. Luthi, Jesse L. Helms; front row, James H. Simkins, Max M. Heller, and Patricia C. Haskell. [Bottom Panel]: The key to Mayor Heller's success was his love for people. Very little happened in City Hall that didn't involve citizen input. He became a driving force for environmental protection, beautification, slum clearance, economic rejuvenation, downtown revitalization and public-private partnerships. Making Lives Better [Top Panel]: Max Heller continued to be concerned for youthful and first-time offenders. In an attempt to control youth violence in Greenville, Max formed a Youth Advisory Committee and appointed as chair a young man who was president of his high school student body -- Knox White who in 1995 became mayor of Greenville. The committee consulted with the city and police officers to bring the youth perspective to government especially relating to recreation and youth violence. [Middle Panel 1]: When Duke Power Company informed the city that it could no longer operate the municipal bus system, Max worked to create the Greenville Transit Authority. He asked Thomas Barton, president of Greenville Technical college to train bus drivers and local churches volunteered the use of buses to cover the transition. [Middle Panel 2]: \"We must cherish our samenesses because we have many more samenesses than we do differences...and our main sameness is they we are all God's children.\" -- Max Heller [Bottom Panel]: In 1975, in a further attempt to bring people together and foster a more cohesive city, Max created the Mayor's Prayer Breakfast, open to all denominations. Even though there was some opposition, most religious leaders supported the breakfast. America's Downtown [Top Two Panels]: The late 1950s and early 1960s saw the decline of downtown Greenville as large outlaying shopping s were built. Store closed and were boarded up. streets became deserted. At the first meeting of the new Downtown Greenville Association, Charles Daniel told the members that the city was \"unclean and neither attractive nor competitive with comparable progressive cities.\" In an effort to renew downtown, Charles Daniel broke ground for his new headquarters on North Main Street in 1964. When completed in 1967, it was the tallest building in South Carolina. At the same time the Greenville News-Piedmont announced plans to build its new headquarters on South Main Street. [Bottom Panel 1]: Under Max Heller's leadership, the revitalization of downtown became a priority in the 1970s. With the help of leaders like Buck Mickel, C. Thomas Wyche, and Alester G. Furman, Jr., a Total Development Plan was initiated by the Chamber of Commerce in 1976. The site of the Woman's College was renamed Heritage Green and there a new county library, the Charles E. Daniel Theatre, and the Greenville County Museum of Art were built. [Bottom Panel 2]: Max Heller's vision of an attractive, inviting, prosperous downtown would eventually become a reality through continued efforts by Mayors William D. Workman, Jr. and Knox White. Today, Greenville's downtown is a showplace and a national model for downtown redevelopment. Elegance of North Main [Top Panel]: Max Heller's vision really began to take shape in late 1978 when the City of Greenville received a federal Urban Development Action Grant for $7.4 million, one of the first in the nation. With these funds the city began to acquire land on North Main Street and through the active involvement of Buck Mickel and C. Thomas Wyche, a new hotel and convention was planned. [Middle Panel]: The Hyatt hotel chain agreed to build the 330-room Regency Hotel, and the city agreed to build a convention , an atrium and five-story office building. The convention was named for Max Heller. This public-private partnership began a new era in the life of Greenville's downtown, bringing new business and commerce to Main Street. [Bottom Panel]: The success of the Hyatt Regency was the impetus for the construction of two large office buildings across Church Street by U.S. Shelter. Revenue sharing funds paid for sidewalks and landscaping. The Coffee street Mall, now Piazza Bergamo, was constructed, and the old Meyers-Arnold Building was transformed into a for the sale of arts and crafts. Economic Diversity [Top Two Panels]: Economic change came swiftly to Greenville in the 1970s and 1980s as the textile industry faced new challenges -- environmental controls, worldwide inflation, and foreign imports. Local mills merged into larger companies and closures began. Max Heller's second term as mayor ended in 1979 and he decided to run for Congress from the Fourth District. He won the Democratic primary but was defeated in the general election. [Bottom Two Panels]: Max was asked by Governor Richard W. Riley to serve as chair of the South Carolina State Development Board and for the next five years he worked with state and local officials to improve the state's economic climate. Max was convinced that diversification was essential and during his term more than 65,000 jobs were created. He created the South Carolina Research Authority and working closely with Governor Riley a number of major industries were recruited to the state, including Michelin North America, Union Camp and Digital Computer. For the first time, annual industrial recruitment reached the $1 billion mark. In the spring of 1987, a blue ribbon task force was formed by the Greater Greenville Chamber of Commerce and led by Max Heller, to address the question, \"What do we want to be in the year 2005?\" The result of their deliberations was a document called \"Vision 2005: Greenville, the Journey Forward.\" This vision called for ambitious goals, including a new performing arts , a year-round governor's school for the arts, a research park, an Upstate coliseum, and a University for Greenville, among others. Inspired Leadership [Top Two Panels]: Max Heller has always been a man of the people. His ability to inspire and foster collaboration among community leaders as well as residents is the foundation of his success. Max's visionary leadership and his lifetime of service to the community led to numerous awards and honors. He received the Man of the Year Award from the National Council of Jewish Women in 1970. He also received the Distinguished Service Award from the Greater Greenville Ministerial Alliance, the Human Relations Award from the Greenville Human Relations Commission and the Whitney Young Humanitarian Award from the Greenville Urban League. The Greenville Chamber of Commerce named its prestigious neighborhood improvement award after Max. [Bottom Panel]: In 1975, Furman University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and in 1998 he received the Bell Tower Award for his exceptional achievements and service to the school. The University also named its award-winning student services program the Max and Trudie Heller Service Corps. Man of the People [Top Panel]: Max Heller...a true visionary and inspired leader. During his lifetime of service he met and worked with many regional, national and international leaders but his true passion always focused on the people and finding ways to bring them together. Max Heller survived the torments of war and religious persecution to become a successful businessman who decided that, rather than retire and enjoy the \"fruits of his labors\", he would devote himself to serving mankind through every means available to him. [Bottom Three Panels]: \"I think you must know who you are. You must have faith not only in God but in other people.\" -- Max Heller \"We must care about everybody.\" -- Max Heller, Mayor, Greenville, South Carolina Greenville's success as a vital and progressive community is a tribute to the leadership of Max Heller, whose unwavering religious faith and commitment to community service provide the foundation and inspiration for his children, grandchildren and all children who will grow to make a difference for our future.",

Hobcaw Plantation Rebecca and James Read�s son Dr. William Read (1754-1845) was a deputy surgeon general in the Continental Army, serving under both George Washington and Nathanael Greene. This was one of Read�s several lowcountry plantations; his principal residence was in Charleston. In 1819 Read�s cousin Jacob Bond I�On (1782-1859), planter, army officer, and legislator, hosted President James Monroe and Secretary of State John C. Calhoun at Hobcaw Plantation.",

Even more fortuitous for the Base were the outstanding civilian and military relationships that existed between the Base and the City of Myrtle Beach. These relationships were epitomized by the close personal and official contacts that developed and grew between the city mayors and base officials. Each of the city mayors and military commanders took pride in these professional relationships and worked diligently to maintain them. This sign is dedicated to those mayors who served during the time the Base was in existence, the first of whom was Mayor Harrelson, who played a key role in garnering land and federal support for the Army Air Base of World War II, and the last being Mayor Grissom, who oversaw the closure of the Base and the initial efforts at redevelopment.

        "Name": "McCormick County / MACK",
        "Description_full": "McCormick County: Gem of the Freshwater Coast McCormick County was named or Cyrus McCormick, a 19th century agricultural equipment inventor, who purchased Dorn's Gold Mine (Town of McCormick) after the Civil War. While it is one of the last counties to be created in South Carolina in the 20th century, its history goes back to the earliest European settlements in the backcountry. French Huguenots (Protestants) settled in the area called New Bordeaux and one of the few structures from this period is the 18th century Guillebeau House located at Hickory Knob State Resort Park. For the outdoors experience, there are many U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state campgrounds, access points to Thurmond Lake, and hiking and bike trails. Those who are looking for other pursuits should visit the \"Book Town\" of Willington, the art galleries at the MACK, and antiques and specialty shopping in the town of McCormick. John de la Howe School Founded in 1797 through the will of Dr. John de la Howe, the school continues to address the needs of children throughout the state. The Barn, built in 1931, serves today as an area country market. Hickory Knob State Park Located on the shores of the 70,000 acre Thurmond Lake, the park offers motel and cabin accommodations, campsites and a variety of outdoor activities including gold, tennis, trails, and boating. Joseph Jennings Dorn Historic House Located in the town of McCormick, this house was designed by J.C. Hemphill around 1917 and is the former home of J.J. Dorn, a local businessman and state senator. J. Strom Thurmond Dam &amp; Lake Built for flood control, this is the largest U.S. Army Corps of engineers man-made lake east of the Mississippi River. It offers a variety of outdoor recreational activities including camping, picnicking, hiking, biking, fishing, and boating. Willington This 19th century community is a reminder of the role the railroad played in the development of rural South Carolina. It is being restored today as a \"Book Town.\" MACK The McCormick Arts Council is located in the Keturah, a former 19th century hotel in downtown McCormick. Its galleries feature local artists and traveling exhibits. Dorn Mill The three-story mill is all that remains of a larger complex, which at one time included a steam-powered cotton seed oil mill and gin, a grist mill, and a related lumber yard. Mt. Carmel This quaint town was once the of business for this rural agricultural community. MACK: McCormick Arts Council of Keturah When local farmer and carpenter W.B. \"Billy\" Dorn, discovered gold in 1852, \"Gold Fever\" struck and within five years a thriving village with a post office called Dorn's Gold Mine, was established. Although gold mining became less profitable after the War Between the States, Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the reaper and founded of international Harvester, invested in Dorn's Mine in 1867. Four years later, Cyrus purchased the Dorn Milling Company and 1,200 acres of land. To increase the profitability of the mines, McCormick used his influence to secure railroad connections to Augusta, GA and Greenwood SC. Through his generosity, land was donated for construction of two churches and a school. By 1880, the settlement had a population of 200 and shortly thereafter Cyrus donated 40 acres to establish a town. The people of Dorn's Gold Mines chose to name their town \"McCormick\" for its benefactors, Cyrus and Nettie F. McCormick. The town was chartered in December 1882 with three unique features. It was (1) build over gold mine tunnels; (2) planned; and (3) the first village incorporated as a \"dry\" town in SC, prohibiting the sale of \"spirituous or intoxicating\" drink for 100 years. McCormick, the county seat, declined when the agricultural economy was affected by the boil weevil, soil erosion, and the depression of the 1930s. The current Town Hall, built in 1938/39 as a WPA project, is located next to the first law office of J. Strom Thurmond, U.S. Senator. After WWII, timber, textiles, and tourism have provided our economic base. Our visitors now come to hunt, fish, swim, golf, camp, and retire at nearby Lake Thurmond -- but they no longer come by train. However, you will see freight trains as you stroll our streets built over gold mine tunnels. From \"Gold Fever\" to a Real Town \"Frontier\" McCormick vanished as new homes and businesses were established. The first commercial building was the Augusta and Knoxville railroad depot, built in 1882. The present station was constructed by 1912 and served as the passenger and freight depot for the community through much of 20th century. When Cotton was King The railroad was a great boon for surrounding farms whose number one cash crop was Cotton. The ease of railroad shipping resulted in the rapid growth of cottonseed oil production. Local investors raised funds through the sale of stocks to construct an oil mill at the northern end of Main Street. This mill later became the Dorn Grist Mill. One of the investors was a leading proponent for the formation of a new century. Birth of a County Hotels were built to handle \"drummers\" and the visitors form eight passenger trains a day. The McCormick Hotel, built as a temperance hotel in 1884, survived at least three fires that ravaged the town. It is located adjacent to the Hotel Keturah that was built in 1910 and has served as the home of the McCormick County Arts Council at the Keturah (MACK) since 1984. The McCormick Messenger, an early weekly newspaper, was established in 1902 with the express purpose of advancing the campaign to form a new county. Fourteen years later, after much debate and litigation, McCormick County was carved from the three existing counties of Abbeville, Edgefield, and Greenwood. Almost a Ghost Town One hundred years after the town was formed, McCormick was included in a 1982 U.S. News and World Report article entitled \"The Real Ghost Towns You Never See in Movies.\" Since then a great deal of time and money have been expended to return Main Street to its early 1900s appearance.",

These protests lasted for more than a year. \"Friendship Nine\" Many Rock Hill protesters were arrested, convicted, and fined. On January 31, 1961, ten students from Friendship Jr. College were arrested when they refused to leave McCrory's. Nine would not pay their fines and became the first Civil Rights sit-in protesters in the nation to serve jail time. This new \"Jail No Bail\" strategy by \"the Friendship Nine\" was soon adopted as the model strategy for the Freedom Rides of 1961.",

        "Description_full": "The McGee Harness Shop was located on the corner of West Benson Street in downtown Anderson. Mr. James L. McGee was listed in the 1905 Anderson City Directory as a dealer in stock, buggies, wagons, and harnesses. By 1910, the small shop located at 131 West Benson Street was part of the Davis Brothers Livery and Boarding Stables which provided horses, mules, vehicles and harnesses, and was open 2 hours a day. By 1925, Elias and Willis McGee became owners of the Davis and McGee Mule Company, which ran a multi-purpose facility with a harness shop, stables, livestock sales and wagon dealership. Their address a 129-130 West Benson included he office of Dr. E.R. Vendergrift, a veterinarian surgeon. In early 1940's, the West Benson Street business was owned by the McGee Brothers (J. Willis, T. Elias, and Wayne L.). There was a harness shop, livestock sales and wagon sales. At the same address were the offices of Mr. Samuel Cathcart, an architect, and U.S. Selective Service System Board #5. By the early 1950's, the McGee Bros. had to remove the harness shop because of the widening of Murray Avenue and the tools were placed in what had been the empty living quarters of a blacksmith at the McGee Farm in Starr. At that time, the current harness shop structure was converted from living quarters to a working harness shop. The placement of the tools and the actual arrangement of the room are authentic to this period of time. In the fall of 2004, the harness shop was moved from the McGee Farm and reconstructed at the Anderson County Museum. The harness shop was a vital part of a community at the turn of the century. The harness shop and blacksmith shop were essential elements of a thriving town. Whenever someone rode a horse, drove a buggy or hitched a team to plow a flied, they were using leather straps to \"harness\" the muscle power of the animal so humans could control it and use it for productive work. In the age when animals still provided most of the power for farmers and transportation, the welfare of the community depended on the skill of the craftsmen who know now to work leather. The harness maker used specialized tools to repair broken harness or \"tack\" and manufactured new equipment when necessary. The harness has four basic functions: It allows the horse to pull the carriage (collars and traces) It provides a braking mechanism (saddle, tug loops, belly bands) It provides a stabilizing mechanism (breeching and holdbacks) It provides a steeling mechanism (bridle, bits and reins) Given in memory of T. Elias McGee and in honor of Ethiel McGee by their children.",

        "Description_full": "In the decades after the Revolution, the woodland surrounding the battlefield was gradually converted to farm fields and pasture. In 1845, James A. Witherspoon led an effort to raise money for a grave monument and recorded several first-hand accounts. \"Mr. Usher whose father, in company with the Rev. Jacob Carnes, and others assisted in burying the dead, states that 84, as well as he recollects who were killed on the day of battle were buried in one large pit or grave, and that 25 who died of their wounds the next day were buried in another grave about 300 yards distant from the others. James A. Witherspoon, Camden Journal, June 18, 1845 Plans for the monument were not realized until 1860, when prominent Charleston sculptor, William T. White, was commissioned to design and create the marble obelisk, which marks the grave.      The Buford Monument Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church was built on this site in 1894. The church only lasted about five years in this location and later moved to the Pleasant Hill community. There are several marked and unmarked graves from this period. In 1946, A.R.P. Synod deeded Lancaster County two acres surrounding the mass grave for use as a public park. This tract was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Archaeologists Tell the Story In 2005, the South Carolina Department of Transportation planned safety improvements at the intersection of SC Route 9 and SC Route 522. For decades, historians had debated the exact location of the Waxhaws battlefield. Archaeologists quickly determined that battlefield evidence extended well outside the two-acre tract containing the mass grave. During a more intensive 2010 study, archaeologists recovered numerous musket balls, gun parts, and uniform accoutrements extending from this area east across SC 522. Careful analysis revealed this was Colonel Buford's battle line that was overwhelmed by Tarleton's troopers. The 84 Virginia Continentals were buried here close to where they fell on May 29, 1780. (Map and Photo Caption) Archaeologists glean a wealth of knowledge from battlefield artifacts. Through careful study of musket balls, buttons, gun parts, etc., they can determine troop locations, weapons used, and even where individuals were killed. Context, or careful documentation of where these artifacts were found, allows archaeologists to reach these conclusions.      The map above shows the artifact distribution. Careful scrutiny reveals how and where the battle was fought, shedding new light on an event that took place long ago. These artificats tell a powerful story about the battle that took place here.",

        "Name": "Military Aircraft Nose Art",
        "Description_full": "The military aircraft nose art is an American tradition dating back to WWII. Living in uncertainty and tension, wartime servicemen found value in naming their aircraft. During WWII, the practice evolved into creating an image to accompany the name.Nose art has been credited with increasing the morale of our servicemen. Service personnel found comfort in attaching the name and image of a well- known personage or protective symbol to the aircraft that carried them into danger. Many chose ferocious or protective names to ward off bad luck or to strike terror in the heart of the enemy. Inspiration for nose art came from a wide range of sources including the most popular being an image of a woman, music, movies, alma maters, sports, comic strip characters, good luck symbols, the grim reaper, the unit's mission and locale and history of the particular aircraft.Nose art is regarded as a form of folk art because it was an individual icon that was nonofficial and sometimes non approved &amp;#8212; sponsored and undertaken by the combat crews. Nose art is essentially a wartime phenomenon. When WWII ended so did nose art temporarily. Five years later, the character of nose art changed somewhat. Unlike WWII, the Korean War nose a did not focus on defeating evil. The country was focused on defeating communism in a distant foreign land. Nose art representing the mission, home, good luck and women continued.Nose art re-emerged during the Vietnam War. While the war spanned the period from 1965 to 1973, nose art had a shorter life span from 1967 to 1970. Stricter regulations were now in place. The units had less planes ruling out the possibility of one pilot to a single plane. An exception was the 355th division where pilots were assigned aircraft and excellent nose art, maintenance and morale were evident. There were some changes, however, as a result of changing attitudes in American society. The personal commitment to the country cause was often absent and reflected in the art. New themes appeared such as peace, and more often the art avoided the subject of the war altogether with cartoon characters, music, television and movies as subject matter. Female nudes were replaced with rock music which reflected the changing attitude about women in society. The average age of pilots during the Vietnam War was 32 years and most were interested in naming their planes after their wives, children, or girlfriends. After Vietnam, there was a long break in the creation of nose art because restrictions were enforced during peacetime. In the early 1980s through 1991 nose art became popular again, beginning with a few selected units, and expanding to all types of aircraft i the Air Force. (Printed with permission from the University of Arizona, Military Aircraft Nose Art: An American Tradition\" parentseyes.arizona.edu/militarynoseant.) Nose art was very popular with the A-10 pilots from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base during the first Gulf War. Lt Col Mike McGee, USAF (Ret) while deployed to King Fahd International Airport in the months leading up to Desert Storm took it upon himself one very hot day to paint the name of the squadron commander beneath the canopy rail hoping that he would like it and want then 1st Lt McGee to do all the jets and then may be let him do some nose art. It was starting to look nice after about a half hour but then out and exhausted from the heat, 1st Lt McGee had to call it a day and he had only half finished the lettering. Back in the squadron building, he pounded down some water and took a nap on the cot set up next to the phones. Suddenly he heard the 354th Wing maintenance on the radio wanting to know who had painted a half finished name on the canopy rail of jet #158. When the squadron maintenance officer finally caught up with him he confessed. Before long, the rest of the unit's pilots started filtering into the squadron to prepare for the night's training sorties. McGee tried to escape before the boss showed up, but was told by his ops officer, Lt Col \"Woozy\" Barton, not to pass go and report directly to Falcon 1. McGee then reported to Lt Col McDow who explained he did not much need his name painted on the plane but asked McGee if he could paint some nose art, a big Warthog face with a smoking gatling gun sticking out of it's mouth. So he painted that one and took the liberty of honoring the boss a bit by stenciling \"Falcon 1\" above the gun chomping Warthog.",

        "Description_full": "\"This Hallowed Ground\" Clemson University was established in 1889 to offer education in applied sciences, including military training. The institution opened four years later and for the next 62 years academic life was organized within an all-male military college setting. This plaza depicts the passage of the cadet through each academic year, represented by four terraces. The military formation of footprints of former students on the second terrace represents the corps of cadets as it then existed. By the close of the third year a complete Clemson man emerged from the mold of the model cadet, rendered by the artist in the twin towers: a man prepared to meet life with determination to achieve his goals, be a good citizen and make a contribution to society. That senior cadet's likeness appears in the sculpture on the fourth terrace. Inscriptions on the wall caps list the major conflicts in which Clemson men and women have served as of 1998. Of the thousands to whom the medals replicated here were awarded, at least three were presented the Medal of Honor. Clemson Military Heritage Corps of Cadets From the arrival of the first 448 students in 1893 through the spring of 1955, Clemson was a military college, strict discipline and regimen were the essence of early Clemson life. This Military Heritage Plaza overlooks the parade ground on which all cadets became instilled with the traits inscribed on these steps and from which thousands marched away to serve this nation in war and peace. Military Veterans Since Clemson's founding, its alumni have served this nation in war and peace, and many sacrificed their lives in battle. They epitomized the spirit of the citizen-soldier who takes up arms out of a sense of duty. The medals displayed here replicate the thousands awarded to Clemson men and women for valor, merit and honorable service while members of the armed forces of the United States.",

The weir, a stone wall with spillway at the highest safe water level, kept excess water in the complex from damaging the mill area. Under the weir can still be seen the outflow arch of a culvert which carried a small stream under the canal bed. The upstream arch has been destroyed by flooding. A basin at the front of the complex allowed boats to pull to the side to load lumber and meal. A flume directed water from the canal to operate the mill wheel, while the canal itself passed between a pair of retaining walls designed to protect the foundation of the mill from being damaged by the flowing water.",

They organized and sent aid and teachers. Newspaper reporters came to document conditions among the refugee slaves. Government officials and notable abolitionists also visited Mitchelville to support its residents. On April 13, 1865, the day before President Lincoln was shot, abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Tilton visited Mitchelville and attended a church service there. John G. Nicolay, former secretary to President Lincoln and then consul to Paris, also attended. The Rev Abraham Mercherson, the pastor and Mayor of Mitchelville, led the congregation in prayer. (captions) (top) William Lloyd Garrison, The New York Commercial Advertiser, April 24, 1865 from Mitchelville: Mr. Garrison was rapturously welcomed, and began his address by reading Moses� triumphal song, Exodus XV, and then, for a half an hour, magnetized his colored constituents, as he detailed the early history of the anti-slavery movement in America. He stated that he believed the colored people were happy to have the franchise at Mitchelville. (bottom left) Sen. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War for Lincoln from 1861 to 1862, visited Mitchelville as part of a Congressional visit to the South after the war.

        "Description_full": "As early as 1673, there is a record of a light burning at what was then known as Charles Towne colony. On May 30, 1767, the cornerstone for a new light was laid on a group of three small islands then referred to as Middle Bay Island. The Charles Towne light was one of ten pre-Revolutionary War lights built in the colony. In January 1790, the newly formed South Carolina legislature transferred the title to the newly formed United States Government. Within a year, the three islands had melded together to become Morrison's (Morris) Island. On December 30, 1860, the State of South Carolina, soon to secede from the Union, took possession of the lighthouse. The Confederates destroyed the lighthouse on Morrison's Island to prevent the Union armies from using the lighthouse as a lookout tower. In 1873, following the Civil War, the United States Congress approved funds for the construction of a new first order tower on Morris Island. Construction began that fall. The finished lighthouse, 158 feet above the ocean, was painted with black and white bands. When first illuminated on October 1, 1876, the Morrison's Island lighthouse could be seen 19 miles out at sea. Explosions on the Folly Beach from live bombs used by the United States Navy during World War II naval training exercises caused cracks to form in the base of the old lighthouse. In 1962, the Sullivan's Island lighthouse became operational and the Morris Island light was extinguished. Resting upon the pedestal above is a 109 feet tall replica of the Morris Island Lighthouse.",

Funds to purchase and operate the home were solicited locally and from friends in the North. It was incorporated in 1883 and is believed to have been the first orphanage for colored children in the State.Side B Room and board cost approximately one dollar a week per child. The children were taught to cook, wash, iron, knit, sew, mend clothes, and all the duties of a household. The older children attended school regularly and made commendable progress in their studies. The orphanage operated here until the building was destroyed by fire in 1920.",

        "Name": "Mount Pleasant Waterworks",
        "Description_full": "In the early 20th century, Mount Pleasant�s leaders and citizens believed that the town�s rural locale and lack of a quality water supply hindered residential growth and prosperity. The situation changed when the Cooper River Bridge opened as the new north-south gateway, placing the town on the shortest New York to Miami route. Leaders sought to capture the hearts of passersby with modernization that upheld the attractive charms of the past. In 1933, Mayor T. G. McCants initiated plans to build a waterworks system for public convenience and municipal advancement. The project was completed by his successor Mayor W. L. Erckmann. Citizens voted 102 to 0 in favor of securing a Public Works Administration loan for the essential water plant. After navigating a difficult course, a distribution system of wells, mains, storage tanks, fire hydrants, 175 water meters and a pumping station provided Side B160,000 gallons of water per day. On October 17, 1935, a dedication was held at Alhambra Park with a dance at the Mount Pleasant Yacht Club. Four years later, waterworks operated at a profit with over 240 customers. A wastewater system was added in 1942 and later, two treatment plants. Captain S. A. Guilds provided astute leadership for over a decade as commission chairman. The first superintendent, C. B. Venning, devoted 34 years to creating an efficient, profitable utility. The office started at Guilds Inn on Pitt Street and later moved to the facility on Center Street. In 1990, the commission acquired Bulls Bay Rural Community Water District. Mount Pleasant set an example for coastal communities by building a water system and was the state�s first city to use reverse osmosis treatment. The Operations Center opened in 1997 on Rifle Range Road. This marker commemorates the 75th anniversary of Mount Pleasant Waterworks.",

        "Description_full": "Mount Carmel, located on the northwestern portion of McCormick County, takes visitors on a trip back in time. The Mount Carmel Historic District is a picturesque example of a late 19th century village. In the early 1880s Mount Carmel turned into a thriving village when the Savannah Valley Railroad passed through it. In February 1885, the town post office was established. Soon after, with the relocation of the Lodiment Reformed Presbyterian Church to town the population increased. An 1894 business directory of the town lists five general stores, a furniture store, druggist, confectionery shop, grocery, carriage maker, two blacksmiths, two gins, shoe shop, four physicians, two hotels, and seven churches. Most of the buildings in Mount Carmel were built during this period of rapid growth from the 1880s to the 1900s. On July 30, 1896, a significant portion of the village was destroyed by fire. Four residences and twelve businesses were lost. Brick building quickly replaced the framed buildings that were destroyed. On August 4, 1906, the Town of Mount Carmel was incorporated. As time marched on, residents began to move toward more industrial areas in search of jobs. The arrival of the boll weevil in 1921 directly affected this highly rural location. The great depression of the 1930s dealt a final blow to what prosperity remained in Mount Carmel. Today, Mt. Carmel is home to the oldest business in McCormick County, McAlister and Sons Furniture Store. Mt. Carmel is also the site of Fort Charlotte, now under water, the location where the first overt act of the Revolutionary War took place. Mount Carmel remains today as a reminder of McCormick County's past and hope for tomorrow",

Upon the death of Staggers in 1863, the ferry was abandoned. On his plantation near here is buried General Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox, the greatest of partisan leaders in the bitter struggle for independence in the Carolinas during the Revolution. This crossing with the dense swamp was used by him most successfully in harassing and eluding the enemy. After the fall of Charleston, the British established a guard here and on the night of August 23, 1780, General Marion, then Lieutenant Colonel of the Second South Carolina Continental Regiment, attacked and captured the post.",

Early in the 20th century, seagoing inlet captains began to take small parties out for day-long charters often in boats they built themselves from local materials. Relying on compass-bearing courses and dead reckoning, these stalwart captains set the stage for the rise of Murrells Inlet as the &amp;#8220;Seafood Capital of South Carolina.&amp;#8221; Their pioneering ventures evolved into the headboats that run Gulf Stream trips today from Capt. Dick�s Marina, as well as our extensive private-charter recreational fleet. As the fishing industry grew, the restaurant trade began to flourish. Fishing out of Murrells Inlet is a multi-million dollar industry today, thanks to the courage and the vision of those captains, past and present and we salute them here. This plaque is in appreciation to these earlier captains now deceased. Capt. Ira Vick � Capt. Albert Jordan � Capt. H. C. Strickland � Capt. Hoss Johnson � Capt. Charlie Strickland, Sr. � Capt.

Deployments were conducted to Germany, England, Egypt, Korea, Hawaii, Cuba and Puerto Rico. All of these deployments were in conjunction with United States Army exercises. These joint training initiatives were used to refine and verify continuing Air Force and Army close air support operational procedures. During the latter part of the decade, the Wing's emphasis began to shift away from the European Theater. Mounting tension in the Middle East resulted in a shift in emphasis to this volatile region. This regional shift in preparedness proved timely when the 354th was the first ground attack unit deployed to Saudi Arabia in August 1990 in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

( nearby marker ) Thunderhog The 354th Tactical Fighter Wing participated in numerous high-profile exercises and deployments during this era. Local exercises, named Thunderhog in reference to the A-10's nickname, stressed developing procedures that made it possible for the Wing's flying units to produce very high sortie rates during simulated combat operations. During Thunderhog IV, the A-10 Thunderbolt II flew 1,270 sorties in 10 days. ( bottom photo caption )Refueling in a chemical environment was an important training aspect of the Thunderhog exercises.

( nearby marker ) Forward Operation Location Training Area The Wing renovated the World War II era aircraft dispersal parking area that was located on the east side of the airfield. This area, called the Forward Operation Location Training Area (FOLTA), was very similar to the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) bases that the A-10 units would be deployed to in response to aggressive actions by the Warsaw Pact (an organization of Central and Eastern European communist states). The FOLTA was used by all of the Wing's squadrons and provided the 354th with a unique training environment.

At that meeting, the Council agreed to purchase 135 acres for a municipal airport, and at the next meeting, named the new airport the Harrelson Municipal Airport in recognition of Mayor W. L. Harrelson's efforts in promoting the construction of an airport. In 1940, federal funds, as part of the National Defense Program, were given to the Town of Myrtle Beach to help construct two runways. In 1941, the United States Army Air Corps expressed interest in the use of the airport for pilot training, and additional funds were made available to lengthen and pave two runways. In November 1941, the War Department, acting under the Second War Powers Act, acquired 6,707 acres to include the municipal airport. Many airfield improvements ensued, and a fighter-bomber group was activated and given the mission of supporting and training pilots and associated air crews.",

Since the establishment of the Air Base Redevelopment Authority, the former Air Force Base has seen many improvements both public and private. In 1996, the City of Myrtle Beach and the Air Base Redevelopment Authority contracted with Design Works, L.C. of Charleston, South Carolina, and created a master plan team to further define and refine the master development plan. In January 1998, Design Works, L.C. created the Urban Village Redevelopment Master Plan. The main impetus of the Urban Urban Village Redevelopment Master Plan was two-fold. First was the desire to diversify the Grand Strand economy by providing jobs and housing opportunities not associated with tourism. Second was the desire to take advantage of the existing base structure of buildings and infrastructure. When the base was in full operation, it acted as an urban village the 4,000 employees and their families who were stationed there and over 12,000 other area residents who had direct association with the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base.

Joseph Blake (1700-1751) inherited (Reverse text) the plantation at her death in 1726 and built a large brick house on this site, one which was noted for its many windows, brick out- buildings, and rare double- row avenue of live oaks. Newington remained in the family until it was sold to Henry A. Middleton in 1837.

In 1775 the village had a dozen dwellings, a jail, and, most importantly, a courthouse, making it a seat of power in the area. Residents included blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, field hands, and slaves. While the 1775 population is not known, a record shows 79 males living here by 1776. American colonists, recent immigrants from Europe, and slaves were among the residents. Cherokee traded here. The land was cleared for crops and animals grazed freely. Water from nearby Spring Branch was plentiful. It was remote and often dangerous in the surrounding wilderness, but inhabitants of Ninety Six achieved a fragile peace in the backcountry. That was changed with the Revolutionary War. In Charleston, Patriot supporters formed an independent government and on September 15, 1775, the royal governor of the South Carolina colony fled to a British warship in Charleston Harbor, leaving the colony in the hands of the Americans. Confused and concerned by these events, backcountry residents split between those remaining loyal to the King and those siding with the Patriots. In Ninety Six, William Henry Drayton, a representative from the new government, successfully converted the townspeople to the Patriot cause, fortified the jail, and sent militias out to contain the Loyalist threat. But the town was too small to accommodate the garrison and Williamson's Fort was built nearby.",

        "Description_full": "Ninety Six played a significant role in the struggle for American independence from British rule. It was the site of the first southern land battle of the Revolutionary War, in 1775, and the scene of its longest field siege, in 1781. Early in the war the British focused on conquering the North. However, they turned their gaze to the South after suffering setbacks in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia.The colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina provided cash crops, including rice, indigo and tobacco, to markets in England. Because of this critical economic tie, many southern colonists remained loyal to British rule. They were called \"Loyalists.\" The British Army recruited these Loyalists to help them fight the American revolutionaries called \"Patriots,\" who wanted independence. The battles fought at Ninety Six were between Loyalists and Patriots, all of whom were born on American soil.The British found that the South was not so easily won. Here in the backcountry of South Carolina residents changed alliances frequently &amp;#8212; siding with the Loyalists when it seemed to their advantage but supporting the Patriots when they felt oppressed by British rule. At Ninety Six the town was firmly in the hands of the Patriots in 1775, but became Loyalist territory by 1780, just before the siege of Ninety Six took place on these grounds.Emerging victorious in the southern battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, the Patriots held their ground and pushed the British northward, forcing their surrender at Yorktown in October, 1781. But the war did not end immediately. Bloody battles of revenge between Patriots and Loyalists consumed areas of South Carolina, until a final peace treaty was signed between the United States and Britain in 1783.",

        "Description_full": "A Brief History of Ninety Six National Historic Site The Ninety Six National Historic Site is an area of unique historical and archaeological significance. In the late 1700s traders gave the town its unusual name because they mistakenly believed this was the estimated number of miles to the Cherokee village of Keowee in the upper South Carolina foothills. By the mid-1700s European colonists found the town a favorable place to settle in spite of increasing troubles with local Indians. In 1760 Cherokees twice attacked Fort Ninety Six, built for the settlers' protection. Located at the crossroads of twelve roads and paths, Ninety Six village reached its peak in the 1770s. This important backcountry town boasted a growing population. 12 houses, taverns, shops, and a newly constructed courthouse and jail. Ninety Six also figured prominently in the Southern Campaign of the American Revolution. The first land battle south of New England was fought here in 1775, and in 1780 the British fortified this strategically important frontier town. From May 22-June 18, 1871, Major General Nathanael Greene, with 1,000 patriot troops, staged the longest siege of the Revolutionary War against 550 British loyalists who were defending Ninety Six. The earthen Star Fort remains as a well-preserved example of an original 18th century fortification. Park Information The park is located on Highway 248, two miles south of the town of Ninety Six. The visitor features a museum with dozens of artifacts and exhibits. A 10-minute orientation video is available upon request. Books and souvenirs may be purchased at the gift shop. A one-mile walking trail allows visitors to explore historic roadbeds, reconstructed siegeworks, the original Star Fort, the reconstructed Stockade Fort, and much more. The site covers just over 989 acres. Because of its importance to the founding of our nation, Ninety Six National Historic Site became part of the National Park Service in 1976. Revolutionary War Encampment Throughout the year, Ninety Six National Historic Site offers a variety of educational programming including reenactments from the Revolutionary era. The Star Fort The fort was constructed with slave labor under the direction of British engineers in 1780. It was constructed according to 18th century standards for earthen fortifications of that type. Being the strongest part of the British fortifications at Ninety Six, it successfully underwent a 28-day siege by the American Patriot army under the command of Major General Nathanael Greene. It stands today as one of the best preserved British fortifications from the Revolutionary War. The Siege of Ninety Six Artist Robert Wilson created this depiction of the crescendo of the 28-day siege when, at noon on June 18, 1781, fifty American Patriots stormed the wall of the Star Fort. It captures the intensity of the struggle from the perspective of both sides.

        "Description_full": "Ninety Six National Historic Site is a unit of the National Park Service, which preserves lands of national significance. This park features the site of the old town of Ninety Six, an important seat of power in the backcountry of South Carolina during colonial times. The park includes some of the best preserved earthworks -- the Star Fort and a military mine -- of the American Revolution. Here you can follow the trails of the Cherokee Indians who first hunted these woods, explore the land where early traders, colonists, and African slaces settled, and visit the scene of struggles for independence from Britain during the Revolutionary War. This map present an aerial view of the entire park. A walking tour from the park entrance past the Star Fort, the Stockade Fort of 1781, and ending at the Logan Log House takes approximately one hour. With more time you may want to venture farther afield to the Gouedy Trail, Cherokee Path Trail, and Star Fort Pond, to enjoy the natural beauty and tranquility of this area that once echoed with the clatter of ox carts and the roar of cannon fire.",

        "Name": "Northern Most Known Bastion of Spanish Florida",
        "Description_full": "Less than three decades after Columbus had discovered America, on Aug. 18, 1521 ( St. Helena's Day ), Spanish seafarers from Santo Domingo sighted this magnificent harbor, named its Eastern headland the Punta de Santa Elena, from which the area derived its name, and claimed it for the King of Spain. For nearly half a century this was the mecca of Spain's repeatedly frustrated efforts to plant a settlement on the Atlantic Coast, Not however until after Ribaut's garrison had abandoned Charlesfort, at what he had called Port Royal, did Men�ndez de Avil�s arrive to prevent further incursions by the French, to assert Spanish sovereignty, and to Christianize the natives. Dispatched by Phillip II of Spain in 1565 with a fleet of vessels and over 2500 colonists, he had made his landfall at Cape Canaveral, expelled the French from Fort Caroline on the River May, established and fortified St. Augustine, and wreaked vengeance on the returning Rebaut. In the summer of 1567 he proceeded to Santa Elena, apparently his original destination; here he planted Fort San Felipe, the northernmost known bastion of the province of Florida and built the city planned for its development. For twenty years Spain's tenure was marked by varying degrees of success, marred by disintegrating relations with the Indians, who destroyed the Fort and the settlement in 1577. The fortress was promptly replaced by Fort San Marcos, its palisades made of cedar logs brought from St. Augustine; but the settlement remained in ashes until 1580 when it was rebuilt to its former condition - - some sixty odd buildings, half of which were tabby. Partially governed by its inhabitants, it furnished what was possibly the first instance of the use of the democratic process, and of woman suffrage in the New World. Both the Fort and the settlement were abandoned in 1587 when the inhabitants were withdrawn to St. Augustine to strengthen its defenses following Sir Francis Drake's raid of the previous year.",

Suffering great sorrow at his loss, Bird sold his home and left town to rebuild his life in Florida. In 1874, Oakley Park was purchased by a renowned Civil War military leader, Major General Martin Witherspoon Gary. The property remained in the Gary family until 1941 when it was deeded over to the Edgefield Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in whose care and keeping it remains to this day. Oakley Park houses a rare and fascinating collection of antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction era artifacts, oil painting, and period furniture, which all combine to tell the story of its colorful history.",

Irish immigrants soon followed to build the Blue Ridge Railroad tunnel through Stumphouse Mountain. Railroad lines began crisscrossing the area and towns like Seneca and Westminster were settled. In 1868, soon after the Civil War ended, Oconee County was formed out of the larger Pickens District. These stories, along with other histories, are told today in the Oconee Heritage Center.

        "Name": "Oconee Station / Oconee County",
        "Description_full": "The South Carolina Frontier Experience Oconee station &amp; the William Richards House This site was a frontier outpost and a meeting place between European American and Cherokees of this region during the late 1700s. The first building here, known as Oconee Station, was built as a garrisoned fort for armed troops and included a military blockhouse. Its initial purpose was to protect white settlers in the area from Indian attack. Soon Oconee Station became used as a trading post. Trader William Richards came to live on the property in 1795 and, in 1805, built a brick residence next to the station building. Military Outposts and Trade The sturdy stone structure at Oconee station housed as many as 30 soldiers at a time over a period of about eight years. We can only guess at the number of deerskins that passed through its doors during and since that time. Deerskin was in high demand in Europe, and Southwestern Indians responded by hunting millions of deer annually for trade. In exchange, they received weapons, cotton and linen fabrics, rum, ornaments, metal tools, and other items. European guns made it easier for Indians to hunt deer, but weapons were also valuable to them in defense against their enemies. Though trade was beneficial to both sides, it was disruptive of traditional Native American life, particularly as hunters. The Indians bartered other goods such as baskets, ginseng, and snakeroot, but deerskins remained their main trade good until Indian removal from the Southeast. Material Cultures In exchange for their valuable deerskin, many Southeastern Indians received clothing made of European cotton and other fabrics, wearing a mixture of European and traditional Indian apparel. The attire of the white Americans living on the frontier also showed a blending. The fringed deerskin jacket associated with the frontiersman is European in construction but Native American in its materials and decoration. The sharing of material cultures between European-Americans and Native Americans revealed the amount of contact between these two groups and symbolized the complexity of their relationships, which ranged from inflamed animosity to friendly cooperation. Defending the South Carolina Frontier As Europeans and European-American settlement expanded across South Carolina, the \"frontier\" moved west. Beginning in 1792, Oconee Station and six similar military outposts served as the westernmost defensive points for new settlers. Scouts based in these stations roamed the frontier areas and served as an early warning network of imminent Indian attacks, giving the alarm to local white settlers. This site was the only station on the South Carolina frontier that remained in operation after 1796. Its use by the military ended after 1799, when the threat of a major Indian attack became highly unlikely. Oconee Station, with its history as a military fort and trading post, reveals the complex and changing relationships between Southeastern Indians and white settlers, as the whites gained land and as the Indian Territory was pushed westward. Oconee County Through a Traveler's Eyes In May 1775 William Bartram, a British naturalist, crossed the Savannah River from Georgia and explored the Keowee River Valley in present-day Oconee and Pickens Counties. At that time, he was traveling through Cherokee lands. Two years later, most of this land would be lost to the Cherokee. Bartram's writings express the beauty of this part of South Carolina. Bartram was especially interested in the plants of the area. He sketched local species and described magnificent vistas. Visitors to Oconee County today can experience the beauty that William Bartram found more than 200 years ago, including the sites highlighted on this panel. Station Cove Falls This site is withing Sumter National Forest adjacent to Oconee Station. It is an east mile-and-a-half from here. Whitewater Falls and Foothills Trail Spanning the border between North and South Carolina, Upper and Lower Whitewater Falls create the largest cascade east of the Mississippi. Here, hikers can access the Foothills trail, which winds 85 miles through dramatic terrain between the Carolinas. Additional access points to the trail are at Jones Gap State Park and Oconee State Park. Oconee State Park Camping, fishing, boating, and hiking are popular activities at this state park, which features recreational structures constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) during the 1930s.",

Many blacks left the church in 1833 during a dispute over seating. Though some later returned, many did not. (Reverse text) In 1852 the congregation moved this building west to face Calhoun Street, to make room for a new brick church, completed the next year. This church, called &amp;#8220;Old Bethel,&amp;#8221; was used for Sunday school before its black members acquired it in 1876. They kept the name Old Bethel and moved the church to this location in 1882. Old Bethel Methodist Church was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.",

        "Description_full": "Old Bethel United Methodist Church, the third oldest church building surviving in Charleston, had its beginnings on February 14, 1797 as Bethel Methodist Episcopal Church. Bethel was constructed in the gabled meeting house style with white clapboards after a design by Francis Asbury, the first Methodist bishop in the United States and was dedicated in 1798. The church was built forty feet by sixty feet and was named Bethel, the Hebrew word for the \"house of God.\" It stood at the corner of Pitt and Calhoun Streets. The building was dedicated in 1798 and was completed in 1809. Later a pulpit was erected and a sounding board acquired from Scots Presbyterian Church was hung over the pulpit. The simple wooden building included galleries for the slaves, pews at the back of the first floor for seating free black members and white members sat in the front on the first floor. In 1851 the church became the primary place of worship for black members. On August 27, 1876 the building was officially given to the black members and became Old Bethel. Land was purchased across the street on Calhoun Street and the building was moved in 1882 to its present site. The original addition of a gabled portico supported by four fluted Corinthian Columns documents changing styles in ecclesiastical architecture. The pressed metal ceiling and Victorian era furnishing date to the end of the 19th century. The church currently serves a black congregation, which includes descendants of the 1880 congregation.

It remained there until 1865 when Confederate soldiers burned it and other bridges to delay the advance of Sherman�s troops. A steel bridge with wooden flooring was built in 1870, using most of the remaining stone piers. It was privately owned until 1912 when Richland and Lexington counties bought it and was dismantled when the current bridge was built. The large stone abutment on the West Columbia riverbank and the regularly spaced remnant of stone piers in the river show where these earlier bridges crossed the Congaree River.",

When farmers built this corral, they cut the posts from Eastern Cedar trees located on the property because this wood is slow to decay. They built the cross members high so an excited animal couldn't jump over the fence. The main section of the corral acted as the holding pen, and the cattle were brought into the narrow shoot to separate them for tagging or for veterinary care. The metal gate at the end of the shoot acted as a head-hold to stabilize the animal.",

        "Description_full": "In 1874 Vardry McBee's heirs leased and renovated an old grain mill on this property to Massachusetts natives O.H. Sampson and George Hall. First called Sampson, Hall &amp; Co. by its founders, the textile mill consisted of two, three-story buildings, each forty by twenty-eight feet. Its stone foundations are clearly visible below this terrace. The mill initially employed between fifty and seventy-five workers. Its 4,000 spindles spun cotton yarn for knitting and crocheting. It became Camperdown Number One when Sampson &amp; Hall opened the Camperdown Mill on the north bank in 1876. In 1885, when Henry P. Hammett purchased the Camperdown Mill. O.H. Sampson transferred its machinery to a new mill outside the city limits. In 1906, Camperdown Number One was sold to Luther McBee, re-equipped and renamed the Vardry Mill. Mill Village On the hills surrounding this site, a twenty-seven acre mill village, complete with churches, mill store and recreation grounds once served the Camperdown and Vardry Mills. Houses were built on both sides of the river. The foundations and road bed of the Vardry Mill village are still visible on the hill side behind you, between this site and the Governor's School for the Arts. Whole families, often including children as young as nine or ten years old, worked at the mill. They rented houses for $0.50 a week per room; water and lights supplied by the mill. The extension of Church Street in the late 1950's destroyed much of the once extensive mill village. Camperdown Mill Greenville's first post-bellum textile mill was founded by Massachusetts mill owners George Hall, George Putnam and O.H. Sampson, who came south to start their business after a disastrous fire in Boston. In cooperation with Vardry McBee's heirs, Alexander and Vardry A. McBee, Hall and Sampson opened the water powered Camperdown Mill (named for the Camperdown elms on the property) in 1876. The mill produced yarn and gingham fabric until 1956, when the Citizens and Southern National Bank built a regional headquarters on the site. It is now the site of Bowater, Inc's American headquarters. Stone retaining walls of the old mill and anchor points of its dam are still visible above the falls.",

It is impossible to fix an exact date because the church records were destroyed in a fire around the turn of the 20th century. Construction on the church began in 1849 and was completed two years later. The bricks were made from clay dug from the banks of the nearby Keowee River. The heart pine floors of the church are original, as are the pulpit and pews. There is a side entrance that leads to a gallery used by slaves. The cemetery contains over 200 graves sites. The earliest, belonging to Lt. Joseph Reed, bears the dates of 1750-1825. The church is the sole survivor of the lost town of Pickens Courthouse and today is in the care of the Historic Pickens Foundation. Pickens Courthouse With the creation of Pickens District, a location for the district's courthouse had to be selected. In 1828 this site was chosen and named Pickens Courthouse in honor of revolutionary War hero, General Andrew Pickens. The town as laid out was eight blocks long by four wide. By the mid-1800s, the town had expanded to include hotels, general stories, a jail, an academy, a Presbyterian Church and many residences in addition to its courthouse. In 1868, Pickens District was divided into Pickens and Oconee Counties and \"new\" Pickens, fourteen miles away, became the new county seat. Many structures, including the courthouse, were moved to the new town. In the 1960s, much of the old town of Pickens was flooded by the water of Lake Keowee.",

        "Description_full": "In the 18th century the wharves along this area of the Cooper River served as a of Charleston's important shipping industry, playing a vital role in the city's economic growth until early in the 20th century. North Adger's Wharf was originally known as Greenwood's Wharf. William Greenwood, a British merchant living in Charles Town, was one of the official consignees of tea taxed by Parliament under the Tea Act of 1773. Under pressure, Greenwood and other consignees allowed the hated tea to be stored in the basement of the Exchange Building, the of colonial Charleston's commercial and social activity. This property, along with Motte's wharf, was purchased circa 1800 by merchant and noted antebellum poet, William Crafts, and later, in 1822, by Arthur Middleton, descendent of a South Carolina signer of the Declaration of Independence. By 1842 the wharves were acquired by James Adger &amp; Company and became the southern terminus of the first steamship line between Charleston and New York. By the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, several masonry cotton warehouses and factor's offices had also been constructed on North Adger's Wharf. As port activities moved up the peninsula in the early 20th century, the wharves were abandoned and the buildings converted to residential and office use. One North Adder's wharf served as warehouse space until converted to offices during the 1950s. The North Adger's Wharf building retains its original 19th century masonry warehouse openings, infilled with contemporary windows and doors.",

Colonel Orr was an Anderson native, the founder and president of Orr Cotton Mills, and a well known philanthropist of his era. Colonel Orr supported the building of an experimental hydro-electric plant at High Shoals. With the success of the first ever long distance transmission of electricity from this plant, Colonel Orr continued to support the effort to electrify both homes and businesses in Anderson. In 1905, the obelisk was placed beside the Orr Cotton Mills on South Main Street and surrounded by wrought iron fencing. On the granite face, his monogram \"JLO\" is artfully intertwined with his epitaph. The obelisk was a favorite symbol for Victorian funeral art and memorials because it represented eternal life. An important features of this monument is the broken top of the obelisk. This was done deliberately to represent 'a life cut short.\" The Orr Monument stood at the original Orr Cotton Mills site until it was damaged during a storm in 2008. For its continued preservation, the monument was moved to this location. The large graphic behind the monument is Orr Cotton Mills in its most prominent era of production.",

        "Description_full": "On the night of November 7, 1780, Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton and his Green Dragoons - together with Harrison�s Provincials, a large unit of Tories from the area between the upper Santee and Wateree Rivers - camped at the plantation of the late General Richard Richardson, hoping to surprise Francis Marion�s much smaller force. Marion learned the size of Tarleton�s force and in the dead of night withdrew east over Jack�s Creek toward the Pocotaligo River and Kingstree. Just before dawn Tarleton received word of Marion�s move and by daybreak was in full pursuit, galloping twenty-six miles &amp;#8220;through Swamps, Woods, and Fastness toward Black River without a Halt.&amp;#8221; But when they arrived at the wide, roadless expanse of Ox Swamp, they stopped, exhausted. Tarleton reportedly said to his troops, &amp;#8220;Come my boys! Let us go back, and we will soon find the Gamecock (General Thomas Sumter, another Patriot partisan leader). But as for this damned old fox, the devil himself could not catch him.&amp;#8221; The story spread until all the people along the Santee and the Pee Dee called Francis Marion the &amp;#8220;Swamp Fox.&amp;#8221; Marion had an ambuscade set for Tarleton at Benbow�s Ferry ten miles east of Ox Swamp on the Black River. Unable to catch Marion, Tarleton punished the surrounding community. Marion reported: &amp;#8220;Col. Tarleton has burnt all the houses, and destroyed all the corn, from Camden down to Nelson�s Ferry... It is distressing to see women and children sitting in the open air around a fire, without a blanket, or any clothing but what they had on ..., for he spares neither Whig nor Tory.&amp;#8221;",

At the beginning of World War II, England desperately needed some fighter aircraft and sought to buy several Curtiss P-40 \"Warhawk\" fighters from the United States. The United States, in dire need of fighter aircraft itself, was reluctant to release the fighters that were scheduled to go to the Flying Tigers in China. North American Aviation (NAA) saved the day by buying plans for a future design (XP-46) from Curtiss-Wright Aviation.NAA modified the design, which became the Mustang, and built and flew the P-51 in 102 days in an effort to meet the British request. The aircraft was an immediate success. The British modified the airplane by replacing the Allison engine with a Roll-Royce Merlin engine resulting in the creation of the best air-to-air fighter aircraft of World War II. By war's end, more than 5,000 enemy aircraft were destroyed by pilots of the P-51 \"Mustang.\" ( photo caption ) Ammunition belts are loaded into the wing of a North American P-51 Mustang at Honnington, England, September 22, 1944.",

        "Name": "Pacolet River Heritage Preserve",
        "Description_full": "Pacolet River Heritage Preserve, owned and managed by the S.C. Department of Natural Resources, covers 278 acres in Spartanburg County, SC. Come to bird-watch, take photographs, fish or simply enjoy the woods and Pacolet River. Leave with a sense of awe sparked by visiting a site important to people thousands of years ago. As you sit watching the river, imagine the lives of the Native Americans who stopped here on their seasonal migrations between the coast and the uplands of the state. What to look for... The preserve protects two Native American soapstone quarries. Early residents of the state came here between 3000 and 1100 B.C. to obtain material to make bowls, pipes, and other necessities. The soapstone outcrops are fragile and should not be touched. Two uncommon plant species, a moss and a leafy liver wort are also protected within the preserve. Less rare, but no less interesting, are the summer pine/hardwoods along the Pacolet River. In summertime, the forest shelters wood thrushes, red-eyed vireos, Eastern wood pewees and yellow-billed cuckoos, along with more commonly-seen songbirds. Reptiles and amphibians love the woods, too. Look for harmless, black rat snakes and Eastern kingsnakes, as well as gray treefrogs, toads and other amphibians. Allow about 30 minutes to walk the short trail from the parking area to the river. When to go... The preserve is open from daylight to dark. Spring and fall are the best times to see migrating songbirds, and the hardwoods should produce good fall color. What is Soapstone? Soapstone is a metamorphic rock found along the collision zones of tectonic plates. To the touch this sock has a soapy or oily feel because its major component is the soft mineral talc. Outcrops of soapstone occur along northwestern margins of the King's Mountain Shear Zone. This geological one marks the boundary between the Inner Piedmont Belt and the Carolina Slate Belt and the meeting place of two ancient continents. Created during the Ordovician period (490 to 443 million years ago) these soapstone outcrops are reminders of powerful geologic processes that produced the South Carolina that we know today. Sometime during the Archaic Period (8,000 - 3,000 BC) Native American people started quarrying this material for use as hunting tools, jewelry and because of its superior ability to with stand thermal shock it was turned into cooking slabs and bowls. Prior to the development of pottery in the Late Archaic Period, 4,000 - 3,000 BC, soapstone was an important raw material for Southeastern Indians. Raw nuts and tubers, a large component of the prehistoric forager's diet, required cooking before they were edible. Archaic peoples, prior to the invention of pottery, devised an indirect method of cooking. Indirect cooking is accomplished by placing heated stones directly into containers holding water and other foods. The hot stones transfer heat to the food while inside the container. Earth ovens were another method of cooking, very similar to dutch over cooking, involving heating stones and dampened vegetable matter. Large pieces of meat or quantities of tubers could be wrapped up in bundles of large leaves then laid over heated stones in a pit, and covered over with soil to cook. The use of heated rocks to cook food has been documented in archaeological sites across the Southeast. After a few uses most rocks disintegrate due to rapid heating and cooling, known as thermal shock, leaving behind fire cracked rock. Soapstone has a superior resistance to thermal shock, and because it is a soft stone it can be carved into easily transportable objects. Perforated soapstone discs have been found throughout the coastal plain and in other parts of South Carolina well away from the material's geologic occurrence. Mobility was important to the people of the Southeast during the Paleoindian and Archaic periods. These people were dependent upon their ability to relocate to areas where they could take advantage of seasonally available foods, soapstone slabs made cooking unpalatable foods in areas of that state that are stone poor a possibility. During the Late Archaic Period, soapstone technology might have assumed a position of greater value to the cultures of the Southeast. Worked soapstone discs and bowls from the Late Archaic Period have been found as far afield as the panhandle of Florida and the coastal plain of Louisiana. These locations are hundreds of miles from natural deposits of soapstone and their presence has been attributed to trade or migration of groups between these areas and upland regions. Also during this period, pottery took over as the predominant cooking technology and potsherds have been found to co-occur with soapstone bowls and discs. While pottery was used for the production of everyday food, feasts might have had communal importance that required the use of soapstone, because with it, large amounts of food could be cooked quickly, and because of its importance as an ancestral tool. In 1969, Terry Ferguson and students from Spartanburg's own Wofford College documented the soapstone outcroppings present within the boundaries of the Pacolet River Heritage Preserve. They are part of a chain of outcroppings that extend from Croft State Park into Cherokee County. Most outcrops exhibit evidence for their use by prehistoric Native Americans. The people who utilized it as a resource likely considered this area very special. We know from ethnographic evidence that prehistoric Native Americans. The people who utilized it as a resource likely considered this area very special. We know from ethnographic evidence that prehistoric people have special connections with areas of unique resources. And now, the Pacolet River Heritage Preserve protects these outcropings. They are as unique and important now as they were them. Today, artifacts from this area help fill in out interpretations of prehistoric times. Disturbing the artifacts, and the soapstone outcrops, harms our ability to learn bout the past from material remains and prevents future research from gaining an accurate picture. Collecting artifacts on the preserve site is strictly prohibited by State Law. The Great Flood of 1903 During the 19th Century, early settlers of Spartanburg County concentrated on developing farms and industries along the floodplains of rivers and creeks. These areas provided good soil for farming and waterpower for mills. When major textile manufacturing decided to take advantage of the Pacolet River. Water provided the power for the large thread spinners and weaving looms at the Pacolet and Clifton Mills. With the opening of these mills, communities developed. Textile mill owners provided lodging for their \"mill operators\" in the immediate vicinity of the mill, because their industrial work schedule demanded they be close to work around the clock. Wages were often paid in store credit, only redeemable at the mill village's company store. The mills generated more than textiles in Spartanburg County, they provided jobs, economic stability and created new communities. Accounts of the Great Flood of 1903... By the sixth of June, 5 inches of rain fell across Upstate South Carolina and western North Carolina. Between 5:30 am and 6:30 am, the waters of the Pacolet River rose 40 feet. The force of this flood battered everything in its path. A dam at Pacolet Mills resisted the flood for a while, diverting the floodwaters into the mills on the west bank of the river. Pacolet Mills No. 1 and No. 2 were devastated by the impact of rushing water and debris. Pacolet Mill No. 3, though severely. The effects of the flood were felt throughout the county. When the waters began receding, 3,500 bales of cotton and 4,500 bales of cloth dotted the banks of the river along with broken machinery and debris that formed constituted businesses, mills and homes. The flood isolated the county from relief. Every bridge across the river, save one wagon bridge washed away, including the Southern Railway trestles crossing the Pacolet and Lawson's Fork. The trestle over Lawson's Fork weighed in excess of 2,500,000 lbs and the flood waters carried it 150 yards downstream. Their jobs, and homes, swept down the river, 3,500 people were temporarily unemployed. \"Mill operators\" were in high demand so companies across the region absorbed the people into their work force. 15,000 people were temporarily homeless after the flood receded. The bridge abutments down this trail are all that remain of a rock and concrete bridge washed out during the Great Flood of 1903. Now it stands as a reminder that the Pacolet River could being devastation to its normally quiet banks. \"...railroad bridges were torn from stone and iron piers, county bridges rolled away like straw, cotton mills crashed before the flood and grist mills and smaller industries innumerable washed off in raging waters. \"All over the sea of angry waters could be seen the projected tops of trees buried beneath the flood, while plank, wood and debris of every imaginable description could be seen floating down stream...\" -- Spartanburg Journal, Vol. III No. 234 Sat., June 6, 1903. \"Untold loss of life, the complete annihilation of Clifton Mill No. 3 and Pacolet Mills Nos. 1 and 2, the injury done to thousands of bales of cotton and newly manufactured goods; 3,500 operatives suddenly thrown out of employment; the complete loss of grist and flour mills, livery stables, post offices, dwellings, stores, churches, and much livestock sum up the work of the floods that occurred between Clifton and Pacolet, on the Pacolet River...\" -- L.N. Jesunofsky, Monthly Weather Report, June 1903.",

        "Description_full": "In 1776 South Carolinians prepared for a British invasion by building a fort on this site. This key position on Sullivans Island, beside the main ship channel, protected the entrance to Charleston Harbor.The fort was designed as a 500-foot square with a bastion at each corner. To build it, thousands of palmetto logs were cut and rafted to Sullivans Island. With double log walls standing 10 feet high, 16 feet apart, and filled with sand, the structure resembled an &amp;#8220;immense pen.&amp;#8221;On June 28, Colonel William Moultrie and the garrison of the palmetto log fort successfully defended Charleston against a British fleet. Later, Moultrie was promoted to general, and the fort was renamed to honor him.( Sidebar : )Above a map of the fort:   This map shows the location and unfinished condition of the palmetto log fort in 1776 when the British fleet arrived. One corner of the fort is illustrated in the drawing above.The fort stood near the site of the present-day Fort Moultrie III, but the exact location of the palmetto fort remains unknown.Above a picture of William Moultrie:   Charleston-born Colonel William Moultrie supervised the fort�s hurried construction. The fort did not look formidable, but Moultrie felt it would protect his men. When the British fleet arrived in June 1776, only half of the fort was complete, and the 400-man garrison had little ammunition and only 31 cannon (the British had nearly 300 guns).Above an image of the South Carolina Flag and a Revolutionary War soldier:   The South Carolina state flag; its blue field, white crescent, and palmetto tree represents the Revolutionary War battle fought here in 1776. The tree represents the fort�s palmetto logs; and the crescent and blue color symbolize elements of the soldiers� uniforms. South Carolina adopted the flag in 1861.",

        "Description_full": "Constructed in 1907, this building originally housed Farmers and Merchants Bank. IN 1934 the newly formed Palmetto State Bank opened here. On Sept. 5, 1934 the bank was robbed by three armed men. The bank had larger than normal deposits on hand because it was the height of tobacco marketing season and the group stole a reported $114,082. Frank English and his wife Geneva were the only people tried for the crime. (Continued on other side) (side 2) (Continued from other side) At trial it was alleged that English was an associate of George \"Baby Face\" Nelson, and that the notorious criminal was involved in the crime, but that was never proven. Frank English was sentenced to 25 years and Geneva English received one year as an accessory. Palmetto State failed due to the robbery, but depositors were repaid by the newly established FDIC. It was the first time an FDIC insured bank had closed in S.C.",

Smallwood�s Continentals pushed forward through their fleeing comrades. Webster, seeing the American front collapse, wheeled his troops leftward to attack Smallwood. The Marylanders checked this assault, taking a position almost at a right angle to the original battle line. Fighting was ferocious, sometimes hand-to-hand.",

        "Name": "Park's / Greenwood County",
        "Description_full": "Park's: America's Most Trusted Gardening Resource Building a Family Tradition Since 1868 It all started in 1867 when 15 year-old George Watt Park, a very enterprising lad, passed around to friends and neighbors a list of seeds he had grown and collected in his mother�s Pennsylvania garden. He then decided to advertise his seeds for sale in The Rural American at a cost of $3.50&amp;#8212;and it brought him $6.50 in seed orders! He then saved up $10.00, bought a hand press and in 1868 printed his own 8-page catalog in his mother�s parlor&amp;#8212;and the George W. Park Seed Company was born! Although founded in Libonia, Pennsylvania, Park Seed had called Greenwood, S.C. home for more than 80 years. How did this change of location come about? You could say that love had a hand in it. At the age of 64, George W. Park met the much younger Mary Barratt, a home demonstration agent from Greenwood, South Carolina. She had written to him for advice on teaching horticulture to homemakers. For 2 years they corresponded and what began as friendship based on their common horticultural interests blossomed into love. They were married in 1918. A few years later, Park moved the company to Mary�s hometown&amp;#8212;Greenwood. Wayside Gardens In 1975, Park Seed purchased Wayside Gardens of Mentor, Ohio and moved its offices here to the Park facility. Early in its history, Wayside became the most respected mail order nursery in the U.S. and the Park family has successfully continued and built on its tradition of excellence. Waysides horticulturists strive to find only the finest quality perennials, trees, and shrubs and travel the world in search of new and unusual garden treasures. Seeds in Space Program In a joint effort, Park Seed Company and NASA developed the SEEDS (Space-Exposed Experiment Developed for Students) program to study what effect the radiation-bombarded environment of space would have on different types of seeds. 14.5 million seeds from Parks were sent into space for almost six years. Upon their return to earth in 1991, the seeds were given to an estimated 4 million students and researchers in the United States plus 30 foreign countries. Data collected from the students and researchers, after growing out and testing the seeds, showed that the plants have very few significant effects from prolonged exposure to outer space. This conclusion has far-reaching implications for future space travel, including the feasibility of life-support systems in outer space. And, most importantly, millions of school children, some perhaps the scientists of the future, were able to participate in this unique hands-on science experiment.

        "Name": "Parris Island Indians",
        "Description_full": "Native Americans on Parris Island People have been living on Parris Island for over 4,000 years. Today, the prehistoric sequence is divided into four major periods. Each is defined by the lifeways of the time. Because these people lived and died centuries before any written accounts, archaeologists study the past to learn about these first inhabitants. Through the clues they left behind, the stories of peoples of long ago can once again be heard. Paleoindian Period 13,000 to 7,000 BC [Picture included] The earliest people in South Carolina are referred to as Paleoindians. Evidence of these early hunters and gatherers has been found in Beaufort County, but presently, there is little confirmed evidence for Paleoindian occupation of Parris Island. Traditional views suggest these people depended heavily upon megafauna- large game which is now extinct. More recent studies suggest those living in the southeast may have had a more diverse subsistence strategy, with greater use of other resources than large game. Archaic Period 8,000 to 1,100 BC Frequent occupation of Parris Island began about 4,000 years ago, during the Archaic Period. Archaic peoples depended less on big game and more on a broad- based hunting, fishing and gathering system. The rich marsh environment here played an important role in the choice of seasonal movement. Greater subsistence diversity allowed an increase in population density and a less nomadic lifestyle. The long term use of village sites, or seasonal reuse over long spans of time, resulted in deep shell rings and middens. Among more notable innovations of the Archaic is the appearance of pottery. Sherds of these vessels, among the earliest yet identified in North America, date to about 2,500 to 1,500 BC, and are fairly common on Parris Island. Woodland Period 1,100 BC to AD 1200 When the Woodland period began, little had changed from the Late Archaic. People still depended upon a broad-based hunting, fishing, and gathering system, and lived in much the same way as their ancestors. About AD 600, the appearance of the bow and arrow signaled many changes in the prehistoric Southeast. These more efficient weapons, combined with an increasing reliance on corn, beans, and squash by AD 1000, allowed people to live in more permanent settlements than ever before. By the Late Woodland palisaded villages appeared in some areas. This may reflect increased conflict as centralized populations came into contact with other groups competing for the same resources, and also now armed with the more effective bow and arrow. South Appalachian Mississippian Period AD 1200 to contact Beginning about the year 1200, the most socially complex societies in pre-European South Carolina came into maturity. Settlers became fairly permanent and territorial control was vigorously defended. Intertribal conflict from this meant palisaded villages remained common early in this period. By about AD 1300, this culminated in a social breakdown and some larger sites were abandoned. As the population dispersed, smaller villages took their place. Subsistence remained a diverse mix of hunting, fishing, gathering and agriculture. In the Lowcountry, shellfish remained a staple of the diet, but maize, beans, and squash were cultivated and remained important. The end of the South Appalachian Mississippian closed with the arrival of Europeans, heralding a new, often tumultuous, era of Native American history.",

        "Description_full": "Taming the Wilderness 1715 - 1750 In 1715, Alexander Parris aquired what would come to be known as Parris Island. By 1722, Parris gave almost half the island to his daughter Jane and her husband John Delabare. Both families established plantations here, but it is uncertain if either planter lived on the island. Many planters maintained their primary residence in Beaufort. The work of the early settlers, done mostly by their slaves, included clearing forests, cultivating crops, and tending cattle. Cattle ranching was an important industry in South Carolina throughout much of the 1700's. Seeking Fortunes1750 - 1790 Rice cultivation flourished in South Carolina, but not around Port Royal. This area lacked suitable freshwater fields, and so had no profitable crop. Most of Parris Island remained forested until a cash crop was found.In the late 1740's indigo production proved to be such a crop. Used for blue dye, it grew well in the Lowcountry and became a prime export for South Carolina, and Parris Island, until the Revolution.Once the indigo boom began, the landscape changed rapidly as fields were cleared. As the need for labor grew, so too did the slave population. Slaves were the primary inhabitants of Parris Island.King Cotton1790 - 1861 In the 1790's Sea Island cotton replaced indigo as the most profitable crop grown here. By then, Parris Island had been divided into five plantations, and into seven before 1825. Most arable land was devoted to cotton fields and few trees remained. Cotton produced also brought with it renewed increases in the labor force. By 1850 nearly 500 slaves lived on Parris Island. The resident non-slave population, in contrast, was very sparse. In 1859 only two planters lived here. Daily supervision was primarily left to overseers. A New Era1861 - 1938 On November 7, 1861, Union forces captured Port Royal Sound and occupied the region for the remainder of the war. Their arrival signaled the end of the plantation way of life. During and after the war, Parris Island's old plantations were divided into small tracts and given to newly freed slaves to farm. These family farms remained in operation until the last civilian residents left in 1938 to make room for the expanding Marine Corps Recruit Depot.",

Long before Mr. Parsons, American Indians lived in and used these rich, productive forests. Settlers in the 1770s worked the land, obtaining what they could from agricultural practices, and cleared most of the timber. By 1920, severe soil erosion created abandoned fields, deep gullies, and soil-filled streams. From this worn out land, the Sumter National Forest was started in 1936. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) planted trees, repaired gullies, fought wildfires, and built roads. In 1935 the CCC built the fire tower on Parsons Mountain and in 1940 they began construction on this lake and recreation area. From its beginning, the Sumter National Forest has provided clean water, timber, wildlife habitat, jobs, and recreation sites for its communities. Parsons Mountain Recreation Area is an example that if resources are used wisely they can be enjoyed generation after generation.",

This space and the warehouses you see along the walkway are a part of the William Aiken House and Associated Railroad Structures National Historic Landmark. This landmark includes the William Aiken House, located at 456 King Street, Camden Depot, Deans Warehouse, the South Carolina Railroad Warehouse located across Ann Street, Line Street Car and Carpenter Shops, and the Tower Passenger Depot. These structures are nationally important because of their role in the development of the railroad industry in the United States. The landmark is named for William Aiken,Sr., who provided both men and money to help establish the South Carolina Canal &amp; Rail Company in 1827. He was an outspoken proponent of the railroad's economic and social benefits to the City, and was a member of a special committee appointed by the Chamber of Commerce to\"inquire into the cost, revenue, and advantages of a rail road communication between the City of Charleston and the Towns of Hamburg and Augusta.\" At the far end of this courtyard are two Gothic Revival-style towers that flanked the entrance to Camden Depot. Behind you is the two-story Tower Passenger Depot. It too, was construicted in the Gothic Revival style in the 1850s. Because of its design, trains had to back into the building to unload passengers. Needless to say, this inconvenient arrangement caused the railroad to convert the terminal to a freight warehouse in 1852. More information about Camden Depot and the South Carolina Canal &amp; Rail Road Company is presented at several locations along the courtyard. An alternate version of the text is available at the Visitors Center. \"On a Rail Road, a traveler may enjoy all the ease, convience, and safety, afforded by the best steam boats, with equal celerity and less motion.\" * Report of a Special Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, 1828* (Maps courtesy of the Library of Congress, Photograph courtesy of the Charleston Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society )",

While participating in a combat patrol engaged in screening an approach to \"Pork-Chop Outpost,\" Private Barker and his companions surprised and engaged an enemy group digging emplacements on the slope. Totally unprepared, the hostile troops sought cover. After ordering Private First Class Barker and a comrade to lay down a base of fire, the patrol leader maneuvered the remainder of the platoon to a vantage point on higher ground. Private First Class Barker moved to an open area firing his rifle and hurling grenades on the hostile positions. As enemy action increased in volume and intensity, mortar bursts fell on friendly positions, ammunition was in critical supply, and the platoon was ordered to withdraw into a perimeter defense preparatory to moving back to the outpost. Voluntarily electing to cover the retrograde movement, he gallantly maintained a defense and was last seen in close hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Private Barker's unflinching courage, consummate devotion to duty, and supreme sacrifice enabled the patrol to complete the mission and effect an orderly withdrawal to friendly lines, reflecting lasting glory upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the military service.

In the early morning hours Lance Corporal Howe and two other marines were occupying a defensive position in a sandy beach area fronted by bamboo thickets. Enemy sappers suddenly launched a grenade attack against the position, utilizing the cover of darkness to carry out their assault. Following the initial explosions of the grenades, Lance Corporal Howe and his two comrades moved to a more advantageous position in order to return suppressive fire. When an enemy grenade landed in their midst, Lance Corporal Howe immediately shouted a warning and then threw himself upon the deadly missile, thereby protecting the lives of the fellow marines. His heroic and selfless action was in keeping with the finest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the U.S. Naval Service. He valiantly gave his life in the service of his country.

McWhorter, United States Army December 7, 1918-December 5, 1944 of Liberty Company M, 126th Infantry, 32nd Infantry Division Killed in Action at Leyte, Philippine Islands, December 5, 1944 Awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor Posthumously October 27, 1945 He displayed gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in operations against the enemy. Private First Class McWhorter, a machine gunner, was emplaced in a defensive position with one assistant when the enemy launched a heavy attack. Manning the gun and opening fire, he killed several members of an advancing demolition squad, when one of the enemy succeeded in throwing a fused demolition charge in the entrenchment. Without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own safety, Private First Class McWhorter picked up the improvised grenade and deliberately held it close to his body, bending over and turning away from his companion. The charge exploded, killing him instantly, but leaving his assistant unharmed. Private First Class McWhorter's outstanding heroism and supreme sacrifice in shielding a comrade reflect the highest traditions of the military service. Private Furman L.

In its attack on a strong point, an infantry company was held up by intense enemy fire. The group to which Pvt. Smith belonged was far in the lead when attacked by a force of 80 Germans. The squad leader and one other man were seriously wounded and other members of the group withdrew to the company position, but Private Smith refused to leave his wounded comrades. He placed them in the shelter of shell craters and then alone faced a strong enemy counterattack, temporarily checking it by his accurate rifle fire at close range, killing and wounding many of the foe. Against overwhelming odds, he stood his ground until shot down and killed, rifle in hand.",

And its hung and towering walls will make you think of the Bastille in Paris.\" At that time the economy of Edgefield County was dominated by the growing of cotton, with almost all economic activity dependent upon that crop. This warehouse, located adjacent to the railroad depot, was a vital part of that economy, providing storage space for both bales of cotton and bags of guano (fertilizer). For over three quarters of a century cotton was stored here. In 1998, the building was acquired by Piedmont Technical College and converted into the Edgefield Center to serve the citizens of Edgefield County.",

Many of these leaders practiced law; others were soldiers and planters. George McDuffie led the state in the nullification movement of the 1820's and 30's. William Barrett Travis and James Butler Bonham led the fight for Texas Independence at the Alamo. Preston Brooks propelled South Carolina towards Secession. Francis Pickens and Milledge Bonham led the state during the War Between the States. Martin Witherspoon Gary and Matthew Calbraith Butler led the 1876 effort to \"redeem\" the state from radical Republicans. \"Pitchfork\" Ben Tillman led South Carolina farmers in the 1890 campaign to wrest control of the state from the ineffective \"Bourbon\" leaders. In the 20th century, Strom Thurmond established a remarkable record of courageous leadership, spanning an extraordinary period of over three quarters of a century. Educators Benjamin Mays and Charles Gomillion provided key leadership in the civil rights movement. Lesser known, but equally heroic, were many Edgefield women who contributed significantly to the political-social and religious life of the region. William Watts Ball, an eminent South Carolina journalist and historian, wrote: \"Edgefield has had more dashing, brilliant, romantic figures, statesmen, orators, soldiers, adventurers, and daredevils, than any other county of South Carolina, if not of any rural county of America.\"",

The parish of St. Bartholomew's was established in 1706, however its first minister, the Reverend Nathaniel Osborne, did not arrive until 1713. An act of the General Assembly provided for a Chapel of Ease in 1725 and Vestry ordered a brick building to replace the wooden chapel. During a visit in April 1737, John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, preached twice at the chapel. (Picture included) Wesley wrote in his diary about how impressed he was to have had so many from so far to hear his gospel. Unfortunately, this church was burned during the American Revolution. According to some records, it was rebuilt between 1819 and 1822, (Picture included) and was used until 1832 when it was again destroyed by fire. The site is often referred to today as \"The Burnt Church.\" No effort was made to rebuild the chapel. Family members continued to use the cemetery. Buried in the cemetery are O'Brien Smith and Aedanus Burke. Smith, the owner of Duharra Plantation, entertained George Washington in 1791 and both Smith and Burke served in the legislature. ( Photograph of Pon Pon Chapel ruins prior to stabilization) The chapel and four acres were deeded to the Colleton Historical Society in 1970 to celebrate the Tricentennial of South Carolina. With additional interest, the Society received a grant from S.C. Archives and History in 1975 to repair the wall of the chapel which had been severely damaged by hurricane Gracie in 1959. The Society in cooperation with others holds various events on the site throughout the year. (Map of 1775 showing location of earliest St. Bartholomew's chapel on Chehaw)",

Along this waterfront ships loaded cargo and departed for Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and other American ports. Exports included timber bound for the Caribbean. Ships returned with imports that included rum, sugar, slaves, and luxury items. By the 1850s cotton replaced rice as Charleston's dominant export.In the mid-1800s, as manufacturing grew in the Northeast and railroads expanded westward, Charleston did not keep pace with the nation's growth. Then came the Civil War. Its aftermath would dominate Charleston's economic recovery for years.Today the Port of Charleston has regained its prosperity. It is the largest container port along the Southeast and Gulf Coasts and is one of the largest in the country, handling millions of 20-foot container units annually. The port also handles \"breakbulk\" cargo, such as vehicles, machinery, boats, and heavy equipment.Container ships are a familiar sight on the Cooper River, connecting Charleston to ports around the globe.(Caption for background):Charleston Harbor around 1838 as seen from Hog Island (now Patriot's Point).

        "Name": "Portman Dam and Power Plant",
        "Description_full": "In 1889, the City of Anderson contracted with a 26 year old native son, an engineering graduate of the University of South Carolina, to build a steam power plant and water system for the city. Keeping up with the engineering achievements of the day, William Church Whitner became convinced that the long distance transmission of electric energy using hydropower would be developed in Anderson. On May 1, 1895, a group of Anderson's business and community leaders ventured to McFall's Mill at High Shoals on the Rocky River to witness history or to watch Whitner's folly, whichever the case. W.C. Whitner, chief engineer of the Anderson Water, Light, and Power Company, had rented space in McGill's grist and flour mill to install an experimental 5,000 volt alternating current generator to attempt to generate and transmit electric power 6 miles from there to the water system pumps at the Tribble Street power and water yard in Anderson. It Worked! This was the first successful long distance transmission of electricity in the South. Based upon this success, Mr. Whitner was able to secure the financial backing to construct a larger dam and power plant at Portman Shoals on the Seneca River, 11 miles west of this spot. At Portman Shoals, the Anderson Water, Light, and Power Company built a 10,000 volt generator facility. When it was placed in service on November 1, 1897, the Portman Shoals Power Plant was the first hydroelectric facility to generate high voltage power without step-up transformers in the nation and perhaps in the world. These generators served not only the Anderson water system, the city street lights, other commercial interests and private homes, but more importantly, Anderson Cotton Mill, the first cotton mill in the South to be operated by electricity transmitted over long distance lines. The course of industrial development in the South was forever changed. Due to its \"unlimited\" supply of electric power, The Charleston News and Courier dubbed Anderson \"The Electric City\" in 1895. [Reverse, Leftmost Marker]: This generator, manufactured by Westinghouse Electric Company on March 28, 1911, was one of 5 similar units still in service at the Portman Shoals Power Plant on December 9, 1960, when the plant was shut down for the final time due to impending flooding by the waters of Lake Hartwell. It was displayed for many years at the Coleman Recreation Center on Murray Avenue. This is an Alternating Current Generator that produced 1,390 KVA at 2,300 volts and 303 amps per terminal. It generated 2 phase, 60 cycle power and operated at 225 rpm. While the original generators at Portman Shoals were destroyed by flooding due to dam breaks and electric fires that plagued the plant in its first years, this generator was nonetheless manufactured at a time when electric power generation was in its infancy. [Reverse, Rightmost Marker]: Building upon his early success in Anderson, William Church Whitner developed hydroelectric power generating stations for a number of communities throughout the South, including Columbus, Griffin, and Elberton, Georgia. One of his earliest employees was a young Citadel engineering graduate named William States Lee. At the Catawba River in York County, South Carolina, he partnered with Dr. W. Gill Wylie. The Catawba Plant experienced financial difficulties and Mr. Whitner was offered and accepted a job with Virginia Railway and Power Company in Richmond, Virginia. Dr. Wylie later found funding to complete the Catawba project, using Whitner's original design, in one of his patients, James B. Duke, who was interested in investing in this new idea of long distance transmission of hydroelectric power. Of course, the history of Duke Energy Corporation and the role played by W.S. (Bill) Lee and Dr. Wylie is one of the great success stories in the industrialization of the southern United States.",

Bethea attended Marion County schools and tradition says he was an avid reader and strong believer in education. His beliefs in education and hard work were to lead him to a successful career as a local merchant and community leader. He was active with his church Weston Chapel and Masonic Lodge. It was because of this dedication to community that he was appointed by President Grover Cleveland to become Postmaster in July 1890.

A storage facility for ammunition, the magazine had a vaulted roof, 48 inch walls, and supporting butteresses and pillars. Although local patriots fortified the structure with earthworks in 1780, British forces easily occupied the area and used the magazine for their own purposes. During the British evacuation of Camden the following year, the structure was destroyed. Archeological excavations conducted in 1968 resulted in the reconstruction of the magazine foundations and a portion of the surrounding fortifications.",

This powder magazine was designed to keep the fort�s supply of black powder safe, dry, and away from flame. The thick walls and solid brick traverse in front of the entrance helped protect the magazine in war-time, but preserving the powder was also an important peace-time task.To protect the powder from fire, a lightning rod was erected and spark-producing metals were kept out of the magazine. To keep the powder dry, the magazine was well-ventilated and the barrels of powder were periodically taken out to the magazine yard and rolled to prevent caking.The magazine is restored as it appeared in 1840.",

When Confederate batteries bombarded the fort in April 1861, the resulting fire threatened the magazine, causing Major Robert Anderson to surrender rather than endanger his men.",

        "Description_full": "When the Powder Magazine was built in 1712, South Carolina was a proprietary colony owned by eight British aristocrats. Seven years later, the colonists peacefully overthrew the Lords Proprietor and South Carolina became a royal colony. The flags flying in front of the Powder Magazine symbolizes Charles Towne's connection to the British Empire. The Cross of St. Andrew The Cross of St. Andrew is the national flag of Scotland. The white diagonal cross on a blue background represents the martyrdom of Scotland's patron saint, St. Andrew, who was crucified in AD 69 on a diagonal cross. Union Flag This flag, commonly referred to as the pre-1801 Union flag, combines the Crosses of St. Andrew and St. George. Dating from the early 1600s, the Union flag became the official flag of Great Britain after the Act of Union in 1707 that joined England and Scotland. The pre-1801 Union flag looks slightly different from the one presently in use. A red diagonal cross was added to the Union flag after Ireland's incorporation into the United Kingdom. The Cross of St. George The Cross of St. George is the national flag of England. The red cross on a white background represents St. George, England's patron saint.",

        "Description_full": "The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, had awarded in the name of the Congress the Medal of Honor to Lt. Colonel George L. Mabry, Jr. United States Army for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the rick of his life above and beyond the call of duty: Lieutenant Colonel George L. Mabry, Jr., 2d Battalion, 8th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity, at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty. He was commanding the 2d battalion, 8th Infantry, in an attack through the Hurtgen Forest near Schevenhutte, Germany, on 20 November 1944. During the early phases of the assault, the leading elements of his battalion were halted by a minefield and immobilized by heavy hostile fire. Advancing along into the mined area, Colonel Mabry established a safe route of passage. He then moved ahead of the foremost scouts, personally leading the attack, until confronted by a boobytrapped double concerina obstacle. With the assistance of the scouts, he disconnected the explosives and cut a path through the wire. Upon moving through the opening, he observed three enemy in foxholes whom he captured at bayonet point. Driving steadily forward he paced the assault against three log bunkers which housed mutually supported automatic weapons. Racing up a slope ahead of his men, he found the initial bunker deserted, then pushed on to the second where he was suddenly confronted by nine onrushing enemy. Using the butt of his rifle, he felled one adversary and bayoneted a second, before his scouts came to his aid and assisted him in overcoming the others in hand-to-hand combat. Accompanied by the riflemen, he charged the third bunker under pointblank small-arms fire and led the way into the fortification from which he prodded six enemy at bayonet point. Following the consolidation of the area, he led his battalion across 300 yards of firesweep terrain to seize elevated ground upon which he established a defensive position which menaced the enemy on both flanks, and provided his regiment a firm foothold on the Cologne Plain. Colonel Mabry's superlative courage, daring, and leadership in an operation of major importance exemplify the finest characteristics of the military service.

The Vietnam War Upper Plaque: During the 1950's and 1960's the United States struggled with communism and the Cold War. In the years leading to the Vietnam War Presbyterian College was at the forefront in providing leadership to the U.S. Military. During this period Presbyterian College's outstanding ROTC program commissioned 20-25 officers each year. PC ROTC graduates served in positions from Lieutenant to Major General. To grasp the magnitude and depth of sacrifices of graduates in Vietnam, dates and events of the U.S. involvement are instructive: � 31 December 1961: 3,205 U.S. advisers were in Vietnam. � 8 March 1965: first American combat troops arrive. � September 1965: first American division, 1st Cav. lands. � 14-16 November 1965: first major engagement of U.S. and North Vietnamese forces with over 300 U.S. killed. � 31 December 1968: 536,100 U.S. forces in Vietnam with 30,610 KIA. � March 1969: U.S. Secretary of Defense announces Vietnamization with intent to withdraw U.S. forces. U.S. forces peak in April 1969 at 543,400. � 31 December 1972: U.S. strength at 24,200; 45,926 KIA. � 29 March 1973: last U.S. combat troops depart Vietnam. � 31 December 1973: U.S. strength at 50 personnel; 46,163 KIA, 10,388 non-hostile deaths, and 2,483 MIA. � 30 April 1975: North Vietnam captures Saigon ending war.

As you visit this memorial to learn of the sacrifices PC students have made, to remember a loved one, or to sit and study, please realize that Presbyterian College has long had a special history of service. Some honored here have made the supreme sacrifice for their country; some have achieved significant stature within our country's armed services; some have served with quiet dignity. We now honor, respect and cherish the service of all PC men and women who have served and who will continue to serve with honor, dedication, and love of country. Col. (Ret.) A. O'Niel Crocker Class of 1959 Post Vietnam Military Operations Top Plaque: During the post Vietnam period, the United Stated and its interests were involved in low intensity warfare conflicts. These include the following: � Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in October 1983 � Operation Restore Hope in Somalia 1992 � Bosnia Herzegovina in August 1995 � Operation Full Accounting in S.E. Asia � U.S. Embassies attacked in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 � USS Cole attacked in Yemen in 1998 Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991 were the first major military action since Vietnam. The United States and allies attached to protect Saudi Arabia from Iraqi attack and to force Iraq from Kuwait. The operation involved over 500,000 U.S. forces. On September 11, 2001, terrorists launched simultaneous attacks against the United States at the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center killing 2,749 persons and against the Pentagon killing 188. On October 7, 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom began as the United States and Britain responded with air strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan. On March 20, 2002, Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced with 170,000 troops. Lower Plaque: Presbyterian College Graduates Killed: Ltc. George D.

A wildfire in Savannah National Wildlife Refuge could threaten these communities. Wildfire produces tons of smoke and ash, which spread for great distances. Airborne particles of organic matter and carbon in smoke are pollutants. They threaten persons with asthma and other respiratory ailments. Smoke pollution also impacts transportation. At night, smoke settles near the ground, lowering visibility on highways and at airports. The Fish and Wildlife Service uses prescribed burning to help prevent wildfire and air pollution in nearby communities. When necessary, trained crews burn this marsh and adjacent lands to reduce accumulation of &amp;#8220;fuels&amp;#8221; (dry grass and wood). This process significantly reduces the chances of wildfire and widespread smoke. Prescribed burns are short-lasting and are scheduled so that smokes disperse away from populated areas.",

Herbert Hoover, October 7,1930Imagine a throng of 70,000 people covering the hillside where today you see only thickening forest. A President of the United States had come, for the first time, to a Revolutionary War battlefield in the South. His audience that day was said to be the largest assembly ever seen on the East Coast up to that time. President Hoover's words were broadcast by radio coast-to-coast in the United States-and to Great Britain. Within a year of his visit, Congress established Kings Mountain National Military Park-at last giving this battlefield the federal status and protection the Daughters of the American Revolution had long sought.",

        "Description_full": "During World War II over 400,000 German and Italian POWs were quartered in camps across the United States. In many cases the prisoners were used to fill vast labor shortages in production and agriculture. Their prisoner camps were small communities where they were able to shop at a canteen, put on plays and concerts, have sports matches and take courses in English. Most German POWs were not ardent Nazis. They came to appreciate the kindness they were shown in the US and carried the principals of democracy and American life back with them to post-war Germany. One hundred and fifty German POWs were housed here at Walterboro Army Air Field.Work Dear Mr. Sams, Well indeed, you have guessed it, it is Fritz Mohme, former P.O.W. of the camp Walterboro, who drops you a few lines from Germany ? Please permit me to thank you again for the good treatment which I as well as my boys got on your farm, and the pleasant hours which I was privileged to spend with you. Remembering them is always a pleasant memory for me. Meanwhile I send my best regards, and remain your (sic) truly. FRITZ MOHME Excerpts from a letter POW Fritz Mohme wrote to his former work supervisor Marion Sams, a Walterboro resident. Many POWs formed friendly relationships with their American work supervisors and latter wrote about their excellent treatment. Printed in the Press and Standard, January 1940. Life in Camp \"Prisoners of war shall be quartered under conditions as favorable as those for the forces of the Detaining Power who are billeted in the same area.\" - Article 25, Geneva Convention [Picture included] These former Walterboro Army Airfield barracks are similar to those POWs may have lived in at the base. In accordance with Geneva Convention the POW barracks had to be the same as the barracks provided to US soldiers at the base. - The Press and Standard, 1944 After the War (Newspaper Clipping): German P.O.W. Writes Letter... \"I grew up knowing that my grandfather had worked with the German POWs and had alot of respect for them. And now here was this letter from one of them with such a tribute to my grandparents. He talked about how well they had treated him.\" - Alta Mae Marvin on the receipt of letter from former Walterboro POW Helmut Ulbricht regarding his (?) for her grandparents WR and Alta Marvin during WW II. The Press and Standard, 1945 and 1994 At least two former Walterboro POWs wrote letters to local citizens after their return to Germany. Fritz Mohme wrote of his journey home- seeing Germany devastated and his happy memories of his time in Walterboro to his former supervisor. Mr. Sams sent Mohme a pair of shoes asked for in his letter. Helmut Ulbricht wrote to the grandchildren of his former supervisors WR and Alta Marvin, and in 1994 visited Walterboro with his wife and met the Marvin family.[Picture included] The Press and Standard, 1945 and 1994 (Right column): POW Camp Comes to Colleton [Picture included] Prison Camp For County... Throughout 1943 and 1944 the pages of the local paper, The Press and Standard, bore stark testimony on the increasing labor shortage on local farms and in the local pulp-wood industry. Walterboro actively sought a POW camp to help relieve the shortage and in December of 1944 a camp for 250 German prisoners of war was established in Walterboro Army Air Field.- The Press and Standard, December 1944 (Newspaper clipping) POWs were paid for their labor. A portion was reserved by the government to be payable to the prisoner when he was released and the other portion the prisoner kept and could use at the camp canteen to buy cigarettes, newspapers, food and personal items.- The Press and Standard, 1944[Picture included]: Helmut Ulbricht (standing) worked briefly as a waiter in the Walterboro Army Airfield's Officer's Mess before going to work at a local nursery run by WR Marvin and his wife Alta. Ulbricht and nine other POWs dug ditches, did irrigation work and cut trees at the nursery. Alta Marvin provided the POWs with home cooked meals.- The Press and Standard, 1944 Camouflage School (Newspaper clipping): Camouflage Battalion Arrives... Walterboro Army Airfield was also home to one of the largest camouflage schools in the United States. The art of camouflage was just starting to develop during World War II. Although the school was for all soldiers, pilots training at the base may have gone through the program to learn how to hide themselves if their plane went down in enemy territory. Today the local high school ROTC trains in the same woods of the old airfield. - The Press and Standard, 1943",

Downtown Augusta, with its riverside commercial and recreational development, such as the Riverwalk, has benefited from the dam's flood control. 3. Thurmond Dam is one of 75 hydroelectric dams owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps produces about a quarter of the nation's hydroelectric power. 4. Thurmond Lake offers a variety of outdoor recreation activities in both Georgia and South Carolina. 5.

Gen. Nathaniel Greene sent Brig. Gen. Thomas Sumter, with Brig. Gen. Francis Marion and Lt. Col. Henry &amp;#8220;Light Horse Harry&amp;#8221; Lee, to force the British to abandon the area around Charleston and retreat into the city. As Sumter led a force of nearly a thousand men from Orangeburg, British Col. James Coates evacuated the post at Monck�s Corner and began moving his troops toward the safety of Charleston.On July 17, 1781 near Quinby Bridge, Lee�s cavalry captured Coates�s rear guard and baggage caravan. A portion of Lee�s riders crossed the bridge and clashed with the British infantry ~ loosening so many planks in the process that the rest of Lee�s and Marion�s forces had to march upstream and cross Quinby Creek at a ford. By that time, the British had taken up a strong position in the main house, outbuildings and slave quarters of Shubrick�s Plantation. Against the advice of Marion and Lee, Sumter ordered an assault that quickly turned into a costly stalemate. Marion�s Brigade alone reported eight or nine killed and eighteen wounded.Accustomed to conservative tactics that did not unnecessarily risk their lives, many of Marion�s men deserted after the battle, and Marion himself resolved never again to fight under Sumter.",

        "Description_full": "Address byGeneral O.P. Weyland, United States Air ForceCommander, Tactical Air CommandatReactivation of 354th Fighter Day Wing CeremonyMyrtle Beach Air Force Base,Myrtle Beach, South CarolinaDecember 7, 1956 Governor Timmerman, Mayor Cameron, General Timblerlake, Colonel Gabreski, and honored guests -Just as today the 9th Air Force is recognized as the most powerful, mobile and versatile tactical air force in the world, during World War II it was the largest and most powerful combat force of its kind in the world. As a World War II commander of the XIX Tactical Air Command and of the 9th Air Force, I had ample opportunity to judge the fighting qualities of the assigned units, and considered the 354th Fighter Group of World War II fame to be the finest day-fighter outfit in existence.With the precipitous demobilization following the war, the 354th designation was lost to the Regular Air Force for some years, and many of our air leaders, including General Timberlake and Colonel Gabreski, felt our new fighter wing here at Myrtle Beach deserved to inherit the history, battle streamers and traditions of the old 354th.I would like to review briefly just a little of the history of this unit, that you may better appreciate the past combat record and proud traditions of the fighter wing which is now to be based at Myrtle Beach.The 354th Group was originally activated November 15, 1942, in California, and less than a year later was sent to England as the first combat outfit to be equipped with the North American P-51 Mustang &amp;#8212; the finest air to-air fighter of World War II. They were subsequently called the \"Pioneer Mustang Group &amp;#8212; and \"pioneers\" they were in many ways. From their original permanent Regular Air Force station in East Anglia, they moved to an advanced landing field in Kent, England, with tents for technical supplies, messes and living quarters. They were one of the first outfits to move on to the Normandy Beachhead area, and from there to the end of the war, they seldom stayed on an air strip more than two or three weeks as the XIX Tactical Air Command - Third Army team swept through France, Luxembourg and Germany. The 354th rapidly established a reputation and combat record for other fighter groups to shoot at. I visited the outfit frequently and know that the record established was not a matter of luck. They were an inspired group of professionals. Every mission was painstakingly planned. Following every combat mission, every action and reaction of the enemy air force was meticulously analyzed, and their own combat tactics modified accordingly. The results speak for themselves. The 354th flew 1,384 missions of 18,334 sorties, during which 966 enemy planes were destroyed, and 701 of these were destroyed in air-to-air combat and 265 were destroyed on the ground. Additionally, the group performed many missions in support of General Patton's Third Army, and many enemy ground troops, tanks, vehicles and stores of supplies were destroyed. That combat was not without cost &amp;#8212; 187 pilots and many aircraft of the 354th were lost in combat. Many paid the supreme sacrifice &amp;#8211; some became prisoners of war and later returned safely.A good fighting outfit is made up of good airplanes, manned and maintained by good men, and led by good leaders. We are honored to have the World War II Group Commanders here today, and I would like to tell you just a little about these men, that you may sense a little better the character and traditions of the outfit they led so well. The original commander activated, organized and trained the 354th in this country and led it in combat in the early days when we escorted the heavy bombers to their military targets deep in Germany. The opposing German Air Force, in those days, was strong, cunning and tough - but so was the leader of the 354th. He was a regular officer, a professional, and trained the group carefully and skillfully. He led them himself and soon was an ace with six Germans to his credit. He always carried his attacks through relentlessly and stubbornly, with the result his opponent would usually try to break off first. One day he met a German who was equally stubborn and didn't break off from the attack. There was a head on collision - two locked aircraft spun together down through the overcast. Both pilots, though critically injured, wound up in the same hospital and lived. That man is with us today. Being a regular, he returned to active service after getting out of prison camp, but his injuries finally forced his retirement for physical disability. He is a great officer and leader and a fine gentleman. I would like to introduce him to you - Colonel Kenneth R. Martin. ( adjacent marker ) Reactivation of 354th Fighter Day Wing Address byGeneral O.P. Weyland, United States Air ForceCommander, Tactical Air CommandatReactivation of 354th Fighter Day Wing CeremonyMyrtle Beach Air Force Base,Myrtle Beach, South CarolinaDecember 7, 1956 Continued &amp;#8211; When Colonel Martin was listed as MIA, the senior squadron commander stepped up as group commander. This man had previously fought against the Japanese and had become an ace in the Far East. Being a \"tiger\" he didn't rest on his laurels, but had volunteered for a second combat tour in Europe. He was a great fighter and air leader and ably carried on \"Sleeper\" Martin's traditions. One escort mission which he led deep inside Germany exemplifies his character. The 354th which he was leading had protected the heavies over the target. A relief fighter would be lost over enemy territory for lack of fuel. Shortly after the 354th reluctantly broke off escort, the fighters closed in on the heavy bomber formation and the heavies yelled for help. This 354th Commander, as the leader and most experienced pilot, had conserved his fuel a little better than the other flight members. He ordered the main fighter group on home to save it, and then turned around to rescue the heavy bombers. Single-handedly, he disrupted the German fighter attack, shooting down five aircraft. Having saved the American bombers, he then headed back and glided to a landing on the English coast with empty fuel tanks. He didn't have much to say about the mission, but Flying Fortress crews did. They said, \"It was a case of one, lone American taking on the entire Luftwaffe. This \"one man air force\" was subsequently awarded America's highest decoration for valor the Congressional Medal of Honor, and I think you will agree it was highly deserved. May I present Brigadier General Jim Howard. Over his bitter protests, Jim Howard was moved up to higher staff duty with the 9th Fighter Command Headquarter. Colonel George Bickell, squadron commander and one of the old original hands in the 359th, moved up to replace Howard as group commander. The 354th was on the continent, moving from one new advanced landing strip to another. Their combat skill became uncanny - they seemed to know what the Germans were going to do before the Germans knew it. It seemed as though they could smell them - I should know. One day I was stooging around by myself in a P-51 when I heard RIPSAW Control announce a bogey in the area. I armed my guns, put on more power and started taking on altitude thinking maybe the old man might get himself an enemy airplane. All of a sudden I found myself boxed in by a bunch of 354th Mustangs: apparently I was the bogey. I think George Bickell was a little disgusted with me, but led the 354th through to the end and probably bailed me out of trouble more than once. Proved in combat, a ace with victories, he is now in Headquarters, United States Air Force, and champing at the bit to get another combat command. I'd like to present to you: George Bickell. I think that will give you an insight into the traditions and spirt of the old 354th. It affords me amount of satisfaction, therefore, to read General Orders officially reactivating the 354th: HeadquartersTactical Air CommandUnited States Air ForceLangley Air Force Base, VirginiaGeneral orders Number 59 - 15 October 1956 II.

Weyland, United States Air ForceCommander, Tactical Air CommandatReactivation of 354th Fighter Day Wing CeremonyMyrtle Beach Air Force Base,Myrtle Beach, South CarolinaDecember 7, 1956 Continued &amp;#8211; Ladies and Gentleman, history is again repeating itself as far as Myrtle Beach is concerned. Some of you from the community may remember when construction started at this base back in 1941, and I know most of you are familiar with the \"new look\" the base has taken on since it has been reopened under TAC and the 9th Air Force. Tactical Air Command is proud to regain a \"proven\" station along with a \"proven\" unit. The wing here at Myrtle Beach is to operate one of the latest supersonic series of aircraft that the Air Force has in operation today &amp;#8212; the F-100D. These are fast, powerful aircraft and make some noise &amp;#8212; but this noise is significant as the sound of progress and the sound of peace. We who hear these aircraft are fortunate &amp;#8212; we live in a land of safety and plenty. These aircraft represent not only protection for our homes but for our very way of life. It is a comforting thought to remember.I feel this aircraft deserves a little special recognition being the first supersonic aircraft and the first of the \"Century Series\" in the Air Force. Aircraft like these don't just happen they are the result of long foresight of Air Force planners and the skilled ability of aviation and industrial research engineers and manufacturers. North American may well be proud of its accomplishments and Pratt and Whitney can be equally proud of the J-57 engine with which the F-100 is powered. Both are a tribute to American technology and ingenuity.We are about to mix these ingredients &amp;#8212; a unit with an outstanding record, an outstanding airplane, a fine air base, a community that has displayed outstanding cooperation and hospitality to the officers and airmen selected to man this unit, and, most important, military leadership of outstanding quality, for Colonel Grabreski, new commander of the 354th, is one of the best known of the old professional fighter hands. He was an outstanding ace in World War II and became a jet ace while under me during the Korean War. With these ingredients, we can't go wrong.Gabby, I congratulate you on this magnificent command and wish you success in your task ahead. I know you'll get full support from this wonderful community. Thank you. ( photo caption ) Colonel Francis S. Gabreski (right)receives the official wing flag of the 354th Fighter Day Wing from General Otto P. Weyland (left).",

This white wooden church, which so long served the congregation of the Methodists of Little River as their house of worship, was moved from its corner location to a lot beyond the cemetery on the west.

        "Description_full": "Reuniting with family was one of the first concerns of African slaves who escaped to Hilton Head Island. Slavery split up families. Owners could sell family members for profit or punishment. On Hilton Head Island, and places where freedom seekers gathered, relatives found each other. Immediate and extended families moved into Mitchelville and began creating a community in 1862. Adults walked to their jobs in the town or at nearby forts. Children went to school and shared what they learned with their parents. Elders helped by watching children and tending gardens. Mitchelville families dreamed and worked for a better future. Less than a month after the Battle of Port Royal a reporter for the New York Times on Hilton Head Island wrote: They are constantly arriving ,families together, in dug-outs from the islands on Broad River bringing all their household effects, and finding shelter at the plantation on the island we occupy. The San Francisco Bulletin, January 18, 1862 on Hilton Head Island: A man named David, from Savannah...arms firmly clasped around the neck of a colored woman, she was clasping him just as firmly, a little boy of about eight...hanging on both. David had found his wife Lucinda, and his boy, Frank, who had been sold away from him, and from which he had not seen in eight long years.

        "Description_full": "Religion has played an important part in the lives of the people of Edgefield County. In the 1760's, the great evangelist Daniel Marshall, came to this area and established Big Stevens Creek and Horn's Creek Churches. In 1826 Edgefield Baptists, together with others from around the state, established Furman Academy and Theological Institution, the forerunner of Furman University and the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. The Edgefield church later came under the leadership of the Rev. William Bullein Johnson who became the founder and first president of the Southern Baptist Convention. Other denominations, including Methodists, Episcopalians, and Catholics, were established here in the antebellum period. After the War Between the States, a remarkable former slave, Rev. Alexander Bettis, provided inspiring leadership for the freedmen, and established over forty churches throughout Edgefield and Aiken Counties. These churches were organized into the Mount Canaan Association and, with their combined resources, Bettis Academy, a school for the African American youth of the region, was established in 1881. Another prominent African American educator from Edgefield County was Dr. Benjamin Mays, the mentor of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. From early in the 19th century and throughout the antebellum period, Edgefield County was noted for its superior schools, including the Edgefield Village Academy, the Blocker Academy, and the Edgefield Female Academy. Later, from 1894 to 1913, the South Carolina Co-Educational Institute, located in the Town of Edgefield, was recognized throughout the southeast for its academic excellence.",

        "Description_full": "Before Mitchelville was established, African slaves on the island congregated at impromptu religious services under trees. The churches built in Mitchelville were the of religious, social, political, and educational life. Following Reconstruction, when legal avenues were increasingly closed to African Americans, the church became the legal foundation for the community. Residents of Mitchelville founded the First African Baptist Church in 1862. In 1865 AME Missionaries and residents founded Queen Chapel AME Church. Both churches continue to serve the spiritual needs of Hilton Head Island. The vibrant religious practices of African Americans of Gullah descent, former Sea Island slaves, such as the ring shout, were little understood by outsiders, especially the Northerners on Hilton Head Island. A reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer described religious meetings February 1862: Their meetings, are held twice or three times on Sundays, also on Thursday and Friday. They are conducted with fervent devotion by themselves alone, or in the presences of a white clergyman when the services of one are procurable. They close with what is \"a glory shout,&amp;#8221; one joining hands with another, together in couples, singing a verse and beating time With foot. School In Mitchelville Mitchelville was the first town in the South to make school mandatory. All children, ages six to fifteen, attended schools taught by northern missionaries. Children were only excused if they were needed to help their parents and if the teacher approved. Parents in Mitchelville were very involved in their children's education and they often chose one school over another if they thought a teacher was better suited to their children's needs. Parents gave presents to teachers and donated supplies to encourage certain teachers to remain in their community. Schools also had night classes designed for adult students.",

A few months later, the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed without personnel or equipment to Korea. The 113th Tactical Fighter Wing, including the 119th Tactical Fighter squadron from Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and the 121st Tactical Fighter squadron from Atlantic City Airport, New Jersey, was given the mission of establishing a replacement training unit (RTU) for F-100 pilots at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. The RTU began operation in September 1968 with the arrival of the first 15 pilot students.Prior to its recall, the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing was considered one of the top Air National Guard units in the nation, one of three Air National Guard wings which had been designated by the Secretary of Defense to achieve peak \"combat readiness.&amp;#8221; The District of Columbia Air National Guard unit was established on Memorial Day, 1946, and was federally recognized in October of that year. At that time it was equipped with the P-47 Thunderbolt. In December 1959, the 113th became one of the first Air National Guard wings in the country to be equipped with the North American F-100 Super Sabre. ( photo caption ) The first replacement training unit class to be graduated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base poses outside the 119th Fighter Squadron headquarters. The class, which graduated March 22, 1969, consisted of Majors H. H. Skeen, T. R. Morris, J.R. Mourning and M. W. Talcott; Captains W. F. Rogers, R. M. Foley, I. Melendez, J. C. Gaston, R. R. Fuller, W. D. Atkins, W. E. Gabel and J. D. Constantine; and First Lieutenant M. J. Kelly. ( adjacent marker ) Replacement Training Unit (RTU) 1968-1969 In February 1951, the District of Columbia Air National Guard was mobilized for the Korean Conflict and served for 21 months. Again in October 1961, the 113th was called up for the Berlin Crisis. During this period the unit participated in several United States Strike Command exercises, including \"Bristle Cone\" and \"Swift Strike II.&amp;#8221; The 113th Tactical Fighter Wing gained international recognition in August 1964 when it became the first Air National Guard tactical fighter unit to fly non-stop to Europe. The unit deployed its F-100s from Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, to Hahn Air Base, Germany, on Operation \"Ready Go,&amp;#8221; employing three air-to-air refuelings supported by Air National Guard tankers. This operation was cited by the Department of Defense as demonstrating the Air National Guard's combat readiness and capability to deploy immediately in support of the regular forces. The former Air National Guard personnel assigned to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were programmed for release from active duty during April, May and June 1969. Early in May 1969, the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing, comprised of the 12th Tactical Fighter Squadron from Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and the 119th Tactical Fighter Squadron from Atlantic City, New Jersey, returned to their original bases for deactivation to National Guard status.",

Furman University, whose campus was once located nearby, donated the original six acres, followed by other land grants from adjoining property owners.

In 1975, a small house, known today as Falls Cottage, was acquired and restored. A master development/beautification project was begun in 1990 with city and garden club funds augmented with generous support from foundations, corporations, and individuals. The park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, encompasses 26 acres with nature trails, landscaped gardens, a pond and landbridge, scenic overlooks, textile mill ruins, and historic information plaques.

(Plaque Behind Cannon):A Cannon's Prideby Edward Jack Smith In 1781, when I was shiny and new, I served atop this hill against The British marching through. I was the first gun to fire when the Redcoats came in sight. I demanded retribution, and I challenged them to fight. Firing from the Ramparts into a sea of red, I gave glory to the honor of every patriot dead. The British broke into the woods as fast as they could go, then bogged down with the gators in the mud of the Ol' Four Hole. Now once more, I stand on watch for passers-by to see. I serve as a quiet reminder that their freedom isn't free. From the days of the Revolution, to the World War marching bands, for all who served in Asia, or stormed the desert sands. To all the Patriots yet unborn who will guard our liberty, I thank you for the sacrifice you pay to follow me. July 1999",

This dike crosses over the trunk. Only the gates and their support structures are visible. The gates facing the canal and the field are often kept closed. To flood the nearby impounding: The trunk�s tide creek/canal side gate is raised. Raising tidewater flows through the trunk and forces open the opposite field-side gate, letting water into the impoundment. When the water reaches the preferred depth in the impoundment, the water pressure pushes the field-side door shut. Both gates are kept closed to hold water in the fields. To drain the fields: The field-side gate is raised allowing water to drain out to the tidal creek/canal during low tide.",

Local planters made large fortune cultivating rice - Carolina Gold - in the area's low-lying river estuaries. This crop required a large labor force which meant more African slaves were imported. The slave population was about 85% of the total population of the County throughout the 1800's. Though spared much of the ravages of the War Between the States, the social, political and economic upheaval that followed caused the rice culture to ultimately collapse. Without slave labor to cultivate the rice crop, most of the plantations were doomed. A series of severe hurricanes in the late 1900's delivered a final, devastating blow which ended the rice culture of Georgetown.",

        "Description_full": "On the upper Savannah River near Elberton, Ga., and Calhoun Falls, S.C. lies the Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake -- authorized for construction by the Flood Control Act of 1966 for the purposes of hydropower generation, recreation and flood control. Originally known as Trotters Shoals, the dam site is situated about midway between the J. Strom Thurmond and Hartwell dams and lake projects of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District. The Russell Project Construction of the Russell project by the Corps' Savannah District was initiated in 1976. The District began filling the lake in October 1983. The lake reached its full power pool elevation of 475 feet above mean sea level in the winter of 1984 and covers 26,650 acres of land. in all, about 52,000 acres of land were required for the lake inundation, the dam, road and railroad relocations, project operations and recreational areas. The Dam's structure and Hydroelectricity The Russell Dam consists of a 1,884-foot long gravity structure of about 1.1 million cubic yards of concrete with a maximum height of 195 feet -- flanked by two earth embankments of about 2.9 million cubic yards of zoned material. The Georgia side embankment is 2,180 feet long, and the South Carolina embankment is 460 feet long. The spillway section contains 10 Tainter Gates, each 50 feet wide and 45 feet high. There are five sluice gates with a width of 5 feet, 8 inches, and a height of 10 feet. The powerhouse has four 75-megawatt conventional turbine-generating units and four 75-megawatt pumped storage units. The project is designed as a peaking plant, with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts -- which makes it the largest Corps hydroelectric project in the southeast. The pumped storage feature allows water, after it has passed through the generating unis, to be pumped back into the lake for reuse in generating power. Millwood, Example of a Flooded Site Located on the Savannah River about 5 miles west of the town of Calhoun Falls, S.C., Millwood was the site of a large plantation built in 1833 by James E. Calhoun (Colhoun), brother-in-law and cousin of John C. Calhoun, American statesman and Vice President of the United States. Millwood was a concentrated village allowing overseers to exercise control over 200 slaves, livestock, storage facilities and workshops. One of the first structures built was a gristmill and millrace, completed in 1834. Turbines for the mill were powered by water with a 14-foot drop. Excavation of the site uncovered the foundation remains and debris from about 45 structures inhabited until 1889. In all, Millwood consisted of about 10,000 acres of land. Major crops were cotton and corn. After the decline of the cotton economy following the Civil War, Calhoun faced great financial losses. The concentrated population of tenants, overseers and slaves were dispersed to about one house per 30-40 acres. Numerous small fields replaced the large plantation ones, and a network of roads was built to maintain contacts. Calhoun managed to keep most of his land by renting to tenants and by leasing the use of water power and a gold mining operation. Following Calhoun's death in 1889, a board of trustees continued to rent and manage the estate. The main village became a locally popular \"resort' in the 20th century. Duke Power Company acquired the property in the 1940s to develop hydroelectric power. Upon learning of the plans for the Richard B. Russell Dam and Lake project, the company used the land instead for pulpwood cultivation.",

He developed good trade relationships with the Cherokee Indians, had a son by an Indian woman, and in 1770 acquired title to 100,000 acres of Indian land in what is now Greenville County. He set up his \"Great Plains\" Plantation with a trading post and grist mill on the banks of the Reedy River. Pearis was wooed by both Patriots and Tories when the American Revolution began. When he went with the British, Patriots burned his home, mill, and store. He fled to the Bahamas and never returned to Greenville. Paris Mountain is named for him.",

The Colonial government strongly encouraged inns (or taverns) be constructed at ferry crossings. Such establishments were a popular site for business and entertainment, which were often done together. Usually an operator set up his business in his home. He might provide lodging, but most of his business came from selling strong drink, such as wine, cider, beer and rum. By 1741 the Colonial assembly in Charleston enacted stricter laws on &amp;#8220;tavern and punch houses.&amp;#8221; Such owners had to get the approval of their local justice of the peace before they paid the colony�s annual license fee of 20 pounds in South Carolina currency. Records indicate that many tavern owners avoided paying this fee because they were so far from the coast and there were few authorities in the Upcountry to enforce the laws.",

Along the base of the fountain are the names of the officers of the Anderson Civic Association, the casting date \"1905\", and the dedication to General Robert Anderson. The original location of the fountain was the east side of the downtown 1898 County Courthouse. In 1977, the fountain was moved several yards to the east for a more ed location in Johnston Park. It would remain in that location until it was dismantled in 1993. The fountain was in storage until a grass root fundraising effort, spearheaded by the citizens of Anderson County, saw the restoration of the fountain and its installation at the present museum location. The Robert Anderson Memorial Fountain is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Anderson County.",

Before dawn, without alerting the guards, he piloted the Planter from Southern Wharf to North Atlantic Wharf, near this spot, picked up his family and guided the vessel past the harbor defenses to the Union ships blockading Charleston harbor. This heroic act of bravery made him a national hero and contributed to the Union war effort. Following the Civil War, Smalls was elected to both houses of the South Carolina Legislature and then served five terms in the United States House of Representatives.

The Clarkes remodeled the house ca. 1885 and ca. 1910. Roseville was restored by the Tucker family and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.",

You could hear the laughter of children playing in the creek, lowing cattle and clucking chickens as they searched for food. Ganaway Russell built a small house here in 1867 and enlarged it three times over the next 40 years to accommodate his growing family and guests. Folks lacked motels, air conditioners and automibiles like we enjoy today. Vacationers flocked to the area that is now Highlands, North Carolina to escape the hot South Carolina summers. Their train ride ended at Walhalla where they boarded a horse drawn stage coach for two hard days of bumpy riding on the dusty, unpaved roads. It was a welcome sight when they rounded the curve and spied the large house where the Russell Family provided overnight lodging and good home cooked meals for weary travelers. As many as 80 visitors are said to have stayed in the house at one time when the Chattooga was too deep to cross and folks had to wait several days, and more spent the evenings in tents and hammocks. The guests even included a future president, Woodrow Wilson. Russell Farmstead This self-sufficient farmstead included ten outbuildings clustered around the main house. Barns sheltered stage coach teams and draft animals used on the farm. A corn crib, sweet potato cellar, and smoke house permitted storing food grown on the farm until needed. Cattle and hogs provided meat while the rich soils along the Chattooga River produced abundant vegetables. The cooks frequently served more than 80 guests and reports say they ate as many as 20 turkeys at a single meal. Many of life's necessities like shoes and metal items were made in the sheds and blacksmith shop. Follow the trail behind this sign to spring house that provided drinking water and served as a refrigerator for this proud family. A number of marriages were performed at the attractive location. A tragic fire destroyed the main house and three out buildings in 1988. The farmstead is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Russells William Ganaway Russell (B. 1835, D. 1921) helped drive a herd of cattle west to California and earned money selling meat to gold miners near Sacramento. He sewed his gold coins into a vest for the trip back home to avoid robbers and used the money to purchase this property. In addition to constructing these buildings he built and furnished Mill Creek School House a mile south of here for the many children living in this area.

In addition to constructing these buildings he built and furnished Mill Creek School House a mile south of here for the many children living in this area. Ganaway married Jane Nicholson (B 1851 D 1935) who stayed busy running the inn, especially during the summer. Jane, in addition to raising 15 of their own children, was a midwife, riding a horse to provide help. She also ran a post office in the main house from the late 1800's to early 1900's.",

        "Description_full": "This land... inhabited by Native Americans. This site, once occupied by Native Americans, was a major ceremonial for the surrounding area. The Santee Indian mound is typical of pyramidal, flat-topped mounds that are widely distributed throughout the eastern United States. The mound served as an earthern platform for a temple constructed of upright posts and woven sticks, then plastered with mud. Roofs were thatched with straw. The temples were usually the central features of ceremonial s that may have included smaller but similar mounds with secondary temples or mortuary houses and round burial mounds. Historical documents and archaeological investigations indicate that these ceremonial s often served as major religious and political s, with villages and farmsteads spreading many miles from the . Through archeological digs, evidence indicates that the mound was also used for burials. Archaeologists suspect construction of this ceremonial on the Santee River was begun sometime between 1200 AD and 1400 AD, and that it represents the eastern extension of the mound building culture. The importance of this ceremonial is greater than just one site. The mound complex, the largest ceremonial yet discovered on the coastal plain, represents a hub of late prehistoric activity in the area. Through research here and at other sites, we may be able to one day outline the features of an entire culture. [ Included 2 - 16th Century John White Native American Drawings] (Center Text) ...outpost for the British. Fort Watson was a small British outpost strategically located near the Santee River and the overland roads connecting the coast to the interior of the state. The location provided protection for British supply routes from Charleston to their fortifications at Camden. Built on top of the Indian mound, the fort was constructed by British Colonel John W.T. Watson and occupied between December, 1780 and April, 1781. The American General Francis Marion, [ Picture included] the famous \"Swamp Fox, and Colonel \"Light Horse\" Harry Lee were directed to \"occupy all the passes of the rivers\" and take control of the British supply lines. The American patriots arrived at Fort Watson on April 15, 1781, and immediately cut off the fort from in-coming supplies. The British, caught off guard, had more than one hundred twenty men trapped in the small fort without provisions. With neither the Americans nor the British having artillery power, the battle was a stalemate for several days. Frustrated at attempts to force the ememy to surrender, Major Hezekiah Maham of Marion's forces suggested a log tower to be constructed from which riflemen could fire down into the fort and force British soldiers to abandon their positions. Construction of \"Maham's Tower\" was begun on April 21 and completed in two days. At this point in the battle the fort was vulnerable to the concentrated attack by the Americans at any time. With their defenses breached and on the verge of being stormed by the enemy, the British Garrison Commander, Lieutenant James McKay, surrendered on the afternoon of April 23, ending the eight day siege. [Included picture: Harry \"Lighthorse Harry\" Lee] Even though the action at Fort Watson lasted only eight days, it was however, an important American victory. The loss of this post made the already tenuous British supply lines to the upcountry less defensible. The fall of Fort Watson was an important link in the chain of events that made the British authorities abandon the back country of South Carolina. (Right text)... dedicated to wildness. The Santee National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1942 and is located in Clarendon County, South Carolina. This 15,000 acre refuge lies within the Atlantic Coastal Plain and consists of mixed hardwoods, mixed pine-hardwoods, pine plantations, marsh, croplands, old fields, ponds and open water. This tremendous diversity of habitat supports many kinds of wildlife. The four management units of the refuge stretch over 18 miles along the northern side of Santee Cooper's Lake Marion. A myriad of wildlife species inhabit the varied landscape of Santee. During the winter months, the bald eagle and occasionally the endangered peregrine falcon can be seen. From November through February migrating waterfowl such as mallards, pintails, teal, wood ducks and Canada geeese [sketch included] may be seen.Throughout the year red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks can be viewed soaring overhead, as can a variety of songbirds in the trees. The refuge provides a home for white-tailed deer and other woodland creatures such as raccoons,squirrels and bobcats. The ponds and marches are haven for alligators plus a number of other reptiles and amphibians. Santee offers a variety of outdoor activities for the refuge visitor. Information on activities may be obtained from the Santee Visitor Center. The Center provides an excellent opportunity for the visitor to become acquainted with the refuge before venturing out. Santee National Wildlife Refuge is one of over 500 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The mission of the system is to preserve a national network of lands and waters for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife and plant resources of the United States for the benefit of present and future generations. The Refuge System encompasses over 92 million acres administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior.",

The Blue Marlin occupies the former Seaboard Air Line Railway Station, which served passengers in Columbia. The Seaboard Air Line Railway was created in the 1880s by the consolidation of the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, and a number of other lines in the Carolinas. Eventually, more that 100 lines would be incorporated into the S.A.L. By May of 1899, 65 passenger trains came through Columbia, daily, including the Seaboard Air Line Railway, the Southern Railway and the Atlantic Coast Line. In June of 1899, to insure that a new planned rail line would come through their community from Cheraw, Columbia's city council agreed to lease Sidney Park (now Finlay Park) to Seaboard for $30,000. It turned the park into a rail head (yard) in a matter of a few months, and returned the property to the city in the 1960s. One of the most remembered of Seaboard's trains that stopped at this former station was the Silver Meteor. Begun in 1939, it ran from New York City to Miami, Florida, covering 1,389 miles in 25 hours. The Silver Meteor was diesel powered, had all-reclining seat coaches, a diner, a tavern-coach and an observation car. The streamliner proved so popular that Seaboard had to order new cars the next year and even added Pullman sleeping cars (in dull Pullman Green, spoiling the all-stainless silvery look). The Seaboard Air Line Railroad merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967, and this railway station eventually closed in 1991, after serving Columbia for 87 years",

A graduate of Avery Normal Institute, Clark's first job was teaching African-American children on Johns Island. Her experiences with racial inequalities in the school system inspired her to fight for social change. After 40 years of teaching, Clark was fired because of her membership in the NAACP. She then taught at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, and traveled extensively voicing her support for social justice. One of her greatest legacies was the development of citizenship schools where adult African- Americans learned skills needed to register to vote. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. convinced Clark to accept a position as Director of Education with the Southern Christian Leadership Council. Clark's lifelong passion for human rights and equality of justice inspired others. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter presented Clark the Living Legacy Award. (Left plaque) The very health of our society depends upon constant unfettered reappraisal of our human condition - - of religion and the spiritual goals of life, of politics and our use of power, of economics and the responsibilities of wealth, of justice and its availability to all human relationships, and the search for that real peace which is far more than the absence of war.      Septima Clark (Right plaque) I want people to see Children as human beings and not to think of the money it costs nor think of the amount of time it will take, but to think of the lives that can be developed into Americans who will redeem the soul of America and will really make America a great country.

Sheldon School, which taught grades 1-7, closed in 1942 when the county consolidated its rural black schools.",

The rings, composed largely of shell, animal bone and pottery were sometimes used as habitation sites. Some middens contain post holes, structural remains and large pits used to steam shellfish.(Reverse):The main purpose of the rings remains a mystery. They may have been the gradual accumulation of shell and refuse at the sites, perhaps built for ceremonial purposes or created as public monuments. The nature of the rings suggests that inhabitants successfully harvested natural resources which allowed nomadic bands eventually to settle at permanent locations.",
